Article: From my father I have learned a lot. And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \"May I help you?\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money. I learned: buy only what you can afford. Buying necessary food and clothing won't make us go in debt . The unnecessary things won't give us happiness, which comes from achievement only.

Article: From my father I have learned a lot. And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \"May I help you?\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money. I learned: buy only what you can afford. Buying necessary food and clothing won't make us go in debt . The unnecessary things won't give us happiness, which comes from achievement only. Question: What shop did the author's father own? Answer: | OPTIONS:\n- A bookshop.\n- A coffee shop.\n- A clothing shop.\n- A food shop.\nA: A clothing shop.\n\nQ: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Dear God, I am a boy.

        "user_prompt": "input: Article: Asked to explain whether the government has quietly abandoned its pledge, the Treasury said the UK would probably have to accept the status quo on EU migration as the price of continued access to European markets. \"No country has been able to agree significant access to the single market without having to accept EU regulations, financial contributions to the EU and the free movement of people\" it said.\nCritics have suggested the Treasury's \"Brexit\" calculation demonstrates that the department has no real ambition to see radical reductions in net migration. In the year to September 2014, net migration to the UK was 323,000, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nLast month the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said that \"net international migration to the UK is an important driver of the economy's underlying growth potential\" and leads to a higher employment rate and lower dependency ratio (the number of children and elderly compared to the total population).\nThe OBR's central budget projection assumes net migration of 185,000 by 2021 (they clearly think it unlikely the government will be able to get net migration down to the levels they promised), and it is this modelling that was included in the Treasury report on the costs of leaving the EU.\nThe OBR also looked at higher and lower migration scenarios. A \"zero net migration\" model, it suggests, would lead to GDP 1.9% lower than currently projected and a fall in house prices of 3%, while a higher net figure of 265,000 by 2012 would see GDP 0.8% higher and house prices up an additional 1.3%.\nWhile the OBR assumes that net migration has a positive impact on the economy in the medium-term, those wanting to leave the EU argue that controlling our borders and reducing immigration would be in Britain's long-term interests.\n\"At the moment any EU citizen can come to the UK to settle, work, claim benefits and use the NHS,\" leave supporter Michael Gove said at a Leave campaign event today. \"We have no proper control over whether that individual's presence here is economically beneficial, conducive to the public good or in our national interest.\"\nThe pressure group Migration Watch argues that the effect of immigration on the UK economy is \"essentially negligible\" and claims there is broad agreement that it harms the earnings of the most poorly paid UK-born members of the labour force.\nThe OBR also makes the point that looking ahead 50 years, immigrants arriving now would add to age-related spending pressures.  \"Higher migration could be seen as delaying some of the fiscal challenges of an ageing population rather than a way of resolving them permanently\", it argues.\nNevertheless, it is surprising that the Treasury's calculations don't engage with the immigration debate, given its centrality in the leave campaign's argument.  Many economists argue that Vote Leave's aim to reduce net migration from the EU following \"Brexit\" would have a negative impact on economic growth, at least in the short term.\nIt is likely those making the pro-EU case would rather the referendum debate was focused on household incomes rather than immigration and that may be why the impact of changes to net migration was curiously lacking from yesterday's Treasury report.\n\nProvide a detailed analysis.\noutput: The Conservative manifesto promises to reduce net migration to the UK to the tens of thousands by 2020, but in calculating the cost of Britain leaving the EU in yesterday's report, the Treasury assumes a level still well in excess of that - of 185,000 per year in 2021 and beyond.\n\ninput: Article: A team from Thames Water - the people who look after some of the pipelines in London - were doing a regular inspection on this pipe in Walthamstow Reservoir when they came across this mammoth blockage!\nNope its not a fatberg, its a group of zebra mussels!\nThe molluscs get their name from their stripy shells, and are usually found in freshwater lakes and rivers around Ukraine.\nHowever sometimes they can cling onto boats and end up in there UK as well.\nThe team from Thames Water have said that work will soon start to remove the mussels and clear the pipe.\n\nProvide a detailed analysis.\noutput: Take a look at this picture of a water tunnel in London - see anything unusual?\n\ninput: Article: The data, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, showed some tumours shrank by around a quarter.\nThe compound will now be taken into more advanced trials.\nScientists said we were now in an explosive stage of merging advances in computing with medicine.\nSpotting every difference between a cancerous and a healthy cell is beyond even the brightest human minds.\nSo the US biotechnology company Berg has been feeding as much data as its scientists could measure on the biochemistry of cells into a supercomputer.\nThe aim was to let an artificial intelligence suggest a way of switching a cancerous cell back to a healthy one.\nIt led to their first drug, named BPM31510, which tries to reverse the Warburg effect - the phenomenon in which cancerous cells change their energy supply.\nData from 85 patients showed signs the approach could kill tumours.\nThe trial was designed to test only for toxicity, but in one patient the tumour shrank by a 25%.\nDr Niven Narain, one of the founders of Berg, said it was still early days for the drug, but claimed supercomputing was the future of cancer.\nHe told the BBC News website: \"I think we're at a very explosive stage, this fusion of biology with technology in helping us understand the basis of this disease more fundamentally.\n\"It's going to allow us to make better decisions on how we develop drugs, to whom we give these drugs to so that we're able to increase the survival outcome.\"\nThe results from these patients are being fed back into the artificial intelligence in order to further target the therapy at those most likely to respond.\nThe company thinks cancers with high energy demands will benefit the most and is planning a more advanced trial in patients in pancreatic cancer.\nDr Alan Worsley, from Cancer Research UK, said we were only at the beginning of harnessing the huge advances in computing to understand cancer.\n\"We still don't fully understand how cancer cells get the energy they need to grow or how this differs from normal cells.\n\"It remains to be seen if a drug developed using this information will help cancer patients, but we need to keep finding new ways to find innovative treatments for patients.\"\nBut he said that in order to deliver personalised cancer treatment - that responds to the genetic changes taking place inside each patients tumour - then computers, not doctors, will be analysing the data.\n\nProvide a detailed analysis.\noutput:",

A \"zero net migration\" model, it suggests, would lead to GDP 1.9% lower than currently projected and a fall in house prices of 3%, while a higher net figure of 265,000 by 2012 would see GDP 0.8% higher and house prices up an additional 1.3%.\nWhile the OBR assumes that net migration has a positive impact on the economy in the medium-term, those wanting to leave the EU argue that controlling our borders and reducing immigration would be in Britain's long-term interests.\n\"At the moment any EU citizen can come to the UK to settle, work, claim benefits and use the NHS,\" leave supporter Michael Gove said at a Leave campaign event today. \"We have no proper control over whether that individual's presence here is economically beneficial, conducive to the public good or in our national interest.\"\nThe pressure group Migration Watch argues that the effect of immigration on the UK economy is \"essentially negligible\" and claims there is broad agreement that it harms the earnings of the most poorly paid UK-born members of the labour force.\nThe OBR also makes the point that looking ahead 50 years, immigrants arriving now would add to age-related spending pressures.  \"Higher migration could be seen as delaying some of the fiscal challenges of an ageing population rather than a way of resolving them permanently\", it argues.\nNevertheless, it is surprising that the Treasury's calculations don't engage with the immigration debate, given its centrality in the leave campaign's argument.  Many economists argue that Vote Leave's aim to reduce net migration from the EU following \"Brexit\" would have a negative impact on economic growth, at least in the short term.\nIt is likely those making the pro-EU case would rather the referendum debate was focused on household incomes rather than immigration and that may be why the impact of changes to net migration was curiously lacking from yesterday's Treasury report.\n\nSummarize.\noutput: The Conservative manifesto promises to reduce net migration to the UK to the tens of thousands by 2020, but in calculating the cost of Britain leaving the EU in yesterday's report, the Treasury assumes a level still well in excess of that - of 185,000 per year in 2021 and beyond.\n\ninput: Article: A team from Thames Water - the people who look after some of the pipelines in London - were doing a regular inspection on this pipe in Walthamstow Reservoir when they came across this mammoth blockage!\nNope its not a fatburg, its a group of zebra mussels!\nThe molluscs get their name from their stripy shells, and are usually found in freshwater lakes and rivers around Ukraine.\nHowever sometimes they can cling onto boats and end up in there UK as well.\nThe team from Thames Water have said that work will soon start to remove the mussels and clear the pipe.\n\nSummarize.\noutput: Take a look at this picture of a water tunnel in London - see anything unusual?\n\ninput: Article: The data, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, showed some tumours shrank by around a quarter.\nThe compound will now be taken into more advanced trials.\nScientists said we were now in an explosive stage of merging advances in computing with medicine.\nSpotting every difference between a cancerous and a healthy cell is beyond even the brightest human minds.\nSo the US biotechnology company Berg has been feeding as much data as its scientists could measure on the biochemistry of cells into a supercomputer.\nThe aim was to let an artificial intelligence suggest a way of switching a cancerous cell back to a healthy one.\nIt led to their first drug, named BPM31510, which tries to reverse the Warburg effect - the phenomenon in which cancerous cells change their energy supply.\nData from 85 patients showed signs the approach could kill tumours.\nThe trial was designed to test only for toxicity, but in one patient the tumour shrank by a 25%.\nDr Niven Narain, one of the founders of Berg, said it was still early days for the drug, but claimed supercomputing was the future of cancer.\nHe told the BBC News website: \"I think we're at a very explosive stage, this fusion of biology with technology in helping us understand the basis of this disease more fundamentally.\n\"It's going to allow us to make better decisions on how we develop drugs, to whom we give these drugs to so that we're able to increase the survival outcome.\"\nThe results from these patients are being fed back into the artificial intelligence in order to further target the therapy at those most likely to respond.\nThe company thinks cancers with high energy demands will benefit the most and is planning a more advanced trial in patients in pancreatic cancer.\nDr Alan Worsley, from Cancer Research UK, said we were only at the beginning of harnessing the huge advances in computing to understand cancer.\n\"We still don't fully understand how cancer cells get the energy they need to grow or how this differs from normal cells.\n\"It remains to be seen if a drug developed using this information will help cancer patients, but we need to keep finding new ways to find innovative treatments for patients.\"\nBut he said that in order to deliver personalised cancer treatment - that responds to the genetic changes taking place inside each patients tumour - then computers, not doctors, will be analysing the data.\n\nSummarize.\noutput: Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<poem of joy>>.",

There have been various useful efforts on trying to eliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms during inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In our work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what utterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we start with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates the average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder side during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more likely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage this novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing relevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score through the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label Fine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled by the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL, adopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward signal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms of MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on both diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better than competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation). Moreover, our approaches are orthogonal to the base model, making them applicable as an add-on to other emerging better dialogue models in the future.\n\nIntroduction\nMany modern dialogue generation models use a sequence-to-sequence architecture as their backbone BIBREF0, following its success when applied to Machine Translation (MT) BIBREF1. However, dialogue tasks also have a requirement different from that of MT: the response not only has to be \"correct\" (coherent and relevant), but also needs to be diverse and informative. However, seq2seq has been reported by many previous works to have low corpus-level diversity BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF0, BIBREF4, as it tends to generate safe, terse, and uninformative responses, such as \"I don't know.\". These responses unnecessarily make a dialogue system much less interactive than it should be.\nTo increase the diversity of dialogue responses, the first step is to faithfully evaluate how diverse a response is. There are metrics used by previous work that are correlated to diversity, but not strongly, such as ratio of distinct tokens BIBREF2 and response length BIBREF5. However, a response can be long but extremely boring in meaning, such as \"I am sure that I don't know about it.\", or short but interesting (i.e., contains a lot of information), such as \"Dad was mean.\". Only investigating discrete token output by the model is also not ideal, because these tokens are only a single realization of the model's output probability distribution at each time step, which unavoidably loses valuable information indicated by the whole distribution. BIBREF6 (BIBREF6) manually collect a shortlist of dull responses, and during training discourage the model from producing such utterances. However, an important drawback of hand-crafted rules is that the set of dull tokens or utterances is static, while in fact it usually evolves during training: when the current dull tokens are eliminated, another set of them might reveal themselves.\nIn our work, we begin with a simple yet effective approach to measure how diverse a response is. This metric, which we name \"Average Output Probability Distribution\", or AvgOut, draws information directly from the training-in-session model itself. We calculate it by keeping track of the exponential average of all output probability distributions on the decoder side during training. This metric dynamically measures which tokens the model is biased toward without any hand-crafted rules, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). In addition, since AvgOut is a one-dimensional categorical distribution rather than a dimensionless numerical value like entropy, it naturally carries and conveys more information about model diversity.\nWe then propose three models that leverage our novel metric to promote diversity in dialogue generation. The first MinAvgOut model minimizes the dot product of current batch AvgOut and the exponential average AvgOut across batches, which encourages low-frequency tokens to be generated. The second LFT model uses a labeled transduction method and scales a \"diversity label\" by the diversity score of the ground-truth target sequence during training, while during testing can generate responses of different levels of diversity by tweaking the intended diversity score. The third RL model leverages reinforcement learning, where our novel metric is applied to discrete tokens and serve as a reward signal. In addition, since MinAvgOut regularizes directly on the continuous distribution while RL calculates its reward based on discrete sampled tokens, we simply add up the loss terms of the two models, creating an even stronger hybrid model.\nWe first employ diverse automatic metrics, including Distinct-1 and -2 from previous work BIBREF2 and our novel metric Diveristy-iAUC (which calculates one minus the sum of normalized frequencies of the most frequent tokens produced by the model), plus activity/entity F1s, to evaluate the diversity and relevance of the generated responses. We then conduct human evaluations to verify that these models not only outperform their base model LSTM by a large margin, but are also comparable to or better than an advanced decoding algorithm MMI BIBREF2 and a very competitive model VHRED BIBREF7 on the Ubuntu dataset.\n\nAvgOut as an Effective Diversity Metric\nBy only keeping a static shortlist of boring responses or tokens, one basically assumes that we humans should decide which tokens are dull. However, we argue that we should instead look from the model's perspective to identify dull tokens, because even if the model outputs a word that we consider rare, including it in too many responses is still considered a dull behavior. Motivated by this thought experiment, we propose a novel metric, Average Output Probability Distribution (AvgOut), that dynamically keeps track of which tokens the model is biased toward. To calculate this, during training, we average out all the output probability distributions for each time step of the decoder for the whole mini-batch. The resulting vector $D^{\\prime }$ will reflect each token's probability of being generated from the model's perspective. Note that we do not use discrete ground-truth tokens to evaluate the model's bias, because there is a fine distinction between the two: a statistics of frequency on ground-truth tokens is an evaluation of the corpus's bias, while AvgOut is an evaluation of what bias the model has learned because by generating dull responses more frequently than the training corpus has, it is the model itself that we should adjust. Also note that the reason we take the average is that a single output distribution will largely depend on the context and the previous target tokens (which are fed as inputs to the decoder during training), but on average the distribution should be a faithful evaluation on which words are more likely to be generated from model's perspective.\nTo avoid batches that have AvgOut significantly different from those of other batches, which would lead the model astray, we keep the exponential average of this metric across batches to make it less biased toward any specific batch. Let it be $D$. After training on a mini-batch and obtain $D^{\\prime }$, we update $D$ like the following:\nwhere $\\gamma $ is $0.01$ in our experiments.\nAnother consideration of AvgOut is that theoretically we can have two choices. The first is to use the output distributions when we are teacher-forcing (i.e., only feeding ground-truth tokens); the other is to let the model use its own predictions during greedy/beam-search decoding or sampling. We reason that the former is a much better estimation of the model's bias, because the latter will result in a cascading enlargement of the model bias due to the auto-regressive nature of LSTM-RNN models (i.e., the tokens fed to the decoder are themselves also polluted by the model's bias). Our early experimental results also agreed with the above reasoning.\nAlthough we try to come up with the most faithful evaluation of how diverse a response is, our approach certainly has its drawbacks too. For example, using very frequent words but less frequent combinations of them may result in a good response which will be penalized by our metric. A natural solution to this is to also use bigram and trigram diversities and take a linear combination of them, which on a high-level is similar to BLEU BIBREF8. However, considering even bigram distribution takes up $O(|V|^2)$ space and calculation time, hence we did not try it due to limited resources. However, as will be presented in Section SECREF5, regularizing unigram distributions can already greatly help on higher-gram diversities, while also improving relevance.\n\nThree Models to Leverage AvgOut\nAvgOut can play at least three roles. First, it can be used to directly supervise output distribution during training; second, it can be used as a prior in labeled sequence transduction methods to control diversity of the generated response; and third, it can be used as a reward signal for Reinforcement Learning to encourage diverse sampled responses. In this section, we begin with a base vanilla seq2seq model, and next present our three models to diversify responses based on AvgOut.\nOur base model LSTM is identical to that proposed by BIBREF1 (BIBREF1), which consists of a single-layer bi-directional LSTM-RNN BIBREF9 encoder and a single-layer LSTM-RNN decoder with additive attention.\n\nThree Models to Leverage AvgOut ::: Regularization by Minimizing Continuous-AvgOut\nOur MinAvgOut model (Figure FIGREF3) directly integrates AvgOut into the loss function by summarizing it into a single numerical value named Continuous-AvgOut. We do this by taking the dot-product of $D$ and $D^{\\prime }$ (Figure FIGREF6). The intuition behind this simple calculation is that $D$ can also be viewed as a set of weights which add up to $1.0$, since it is a probability vector. By taking the dot product, we are actually calculating a weighted average of each probability in $D^{\\prime }$. To evaluate how diverse the model currently is, the duller tokens should obviously carry higher weights since they contribute more to the \"dullness\" of the whole utterance. Assuming that $D$ is a column vector, the continuous diversity score is $B_c$, and the resulting extra loss term is $L_B$, the total loss $L$ is given by:\nwhere $\\alpha $ is a coefficient to balance the regularization loss with the maximum likelihood loss (a.k.a. teacher forcing loss) $L_{ML}$. This is important because the regularization term continues to discourage the model from generating the ground-truth token, which we need to balance by ML loss to reduce the impact (otherwise the model will be led astray). Note that since $D$ is a moving average which does not depend on the model parameters of the current mini-batch, only $D^{\\prime }$ will result in gradient flow during back-propagation, which is what we intend.\n\nExperimental Setup ::: Training Details\nFor each of the three models, the hidden size of the encoder is 256, while the decoder hidden size is 512. For MinAvgOut, the coefficient of the regularization loss term $\\alpha $ is $100.0$; For LFT, during inference we feed a score of $0.015$ since it achieves a good balance between response coherence and diversity. For RL, the coefficient of the RL term $\\beta $ is $100.0$. For the hybrid model MinAvgOut + RL, $\\alpha $ and $\\beta $ share a coefficient of $50.0$.\n\nResults and Analysis ::: Selected Output Examples\nWe present two selected examples of generated responses from the investigated models (Table TABREF29). We can see that all our models learn to attend well to the context, generating coherent and informative responses.\n\nRelated Work ::: Measurements of Response Diversity\nMultiple metrics and approaches have been proposed to measure dialogue diversity. Some focus more on how similar the responses are to the ground-truth sequences, such as Word Error Rate BIBREF3 and BLEU BIBREF20, while the others explicitly have diversity in mind when being created, such as Distinct-1 and -2 BIBREF2. The key difference between AvgOut and the previous work is that first, our metric is dynamic with no feature-engineering; second, ours is versatile enough to be applied to both continuous distributions and discrete sequences, while theirs are only for discrete tokens; third, ours can be used for both sentence-level and corpus-level evaluation, while theirs are only meaningful as corpus-level metrics because they measure the extent of repetition across responses rather than for a single response.\n\nConclusion\nWe proposed a novel measure AvgOut to dynamically evaluate how diverse a model or a response is based on the models' own parameters, which themselves evolve during training. We then leveraged this effective measure to train three models, plus a hybrid model, to eliminate dull responses for dialogue generation tasks. In addition, we designed novel automatic metrics to evaluate the trained models on diversity, in addition to the ones from previous work. Both automatic and human evaluations consolidated that our models are able to generate more diverse and relevant responses, even when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. For future work, we plan to apply these models to different generative tasks where diversity is desired.\n\nFigure 1: MinAvgOut model: use the dot product of average output distribution of the exponential average and the current batch to evaluate how diverse the current batch is.\n\nFigure 2: An example of AVGOUT applied to a single token, which readily generalizes to multiple tokens within a response. We calculate diversity score of a continuous distribution through dot product. We sum up the values in the last graph. Note that although “turf ” (the fourth word from the right in all three sub-figures) has higher probability in the current batch D′, it still contributes less than the word “is” to the overall diversity measure when taking the dot product, due to its low probability in the exponential average distribution D (i.e., lower weights). All probabilities are for illustration purpose and do not correspond to distributions from our models.\n\nTable 1: Automatic Evaluation Activity/Entity F1 results for baselines and our 3 models (attn means “with attention”). LSTM, HRED and VHRED are reported in Serban et al. (2017a), VHRED (attn) and Reranking-RL in Niu and Bansal (2018a), and the rest are produced by our work. All our four models have statistically significantly higher F1 values (p < 0.001) against VHRED (attn) and MMI.\n\nTable 2: Automatic Evaluation results for the baselines and our proposed models (“iAUC” means “inverted AUC”, or “1 - AUC”; “attn” means “with attention”; “s”, “1”, “2” and “3” correspond to “sentence-level”, “unigram”, “bigram” and “trigram”, respectively; iAUC-avg is the average of all the other AUC columns). Best results are boldfaced. We do not calculate p-value because it does not apply to corpus-level metrics.\n\nQuestion: How much better were results of the proposed models than base LSTM-RNN model?\n\n\n Finish your response with this exact phrase Oh no..

First, it can be used to directly supervise output distribution during training; second, it can be used as a prior in labeled sequence transduction methods to control diversity of the generated response; and third, it can be used as a reward signal for Reinforcement Learning to encourage diverse sampled responses. In this section, we begin with a base vanilla seq2seq model, and next present our three models to diversify responses based on AvgOut.\nOur base model LSTM is identical to that proposed by BIBREF1 (BIBREF1), which consists of a single-layer bi-directional LSTM-RNN BIBREF9 encoder and a single-layer LSTM-RNN decoder with additive attention.\n\nThree Models to Leverage AvgOut ::: Regularization by Minimizing Continuous-AvgOut\nOur MinAvgOut model (Figure FIGREF3) directly integrates AvgOut into the loss function by summarizing it into a single numerical value named Continuous-AvgOut. We do this by taking the dot-product of $D$ and $D^{\\prime }$ (Figure FIGREF6). The intuition behind this simple calculation is that $D$ can also be viewed as a set of weights which add up to $1.0$, since it is a probability vector. By taking the dot product, we are actually calculating a weighted average of each probability in $D^{\\prime }$. To evaluate how diverse the model currently is, the duller tokens should obviously carry higher weights since they contribute more to the \"dullness\" of the whole utterance. Assuming that $D$ is a column vector, the continuous diversity score is $B_c$, and the resulting extra loss term is $L_B$, the total loss $L$ is given by:\nwhere $\\alpha $ is a coefficient to balance the regularization loss with the maximum likelihood loss (a.k.a. teacher forcing loss) $L_{ML}$. This is important because the regularization term continues to discourage the model from generating the ground-truth token, which we need to balance by ML loss to reduce the impact (otherwise the model will be led astray). Note that since $D$ is a moving average which does not depend on the model parameters of the current mini-batch, only $D^{\\prime }$ will result in gradient flow during back-propagation, which is what we intend.\n\nExperimental Setup ::: Training Details\nFor each of the three models, the hidden size of the encoder is 256, while the decoder hidden size is 512. For MinAvgOut, the coefficient of the regularization loss term $\\alpha $ is $100.0$; For LFT, during inference we feed a score of $0.015$ since it achieves a good balance between response coherence and diversity. For RL, the coefficient of the RL term $\\beta $ is $100.0$. For the hybrid model MinAvgOut + RL, $\\alpha $ and $\\beta $ share a coefficient of $50.0$.\n\nResults and Analysis ::: Selected Output Examples\nWe present two selected examples of generated responses from the investigated models (Table TABREF29). We can see that all our models learn to attend well to the context, generating coherent and informative responses.\n\nRelated Work ::: Measurements of Response Diversity\nMultiple metrics and approaches have been proposed to measure dialogue diversity. Some focus more on how similar the responses are to the ground-truth sequences, such as Word Error Rate BIBREF3 and BLEU BIBREF20, while the others explicitly have diversity in mind when being created, such as Distinct-1 and -2 BIBREF2. The key difference between AvgOut and the previous work is that first, our metric is dynamic with no feature-engineering; second, ours is versatile enough to be applied to both continuous distributions and discrete sequences, while theirs are only for discrete tokens; third, ours can be used for both sentence-level and corpus-level evaluation, while theirs are only meaningful as corpus-level metrics because they measure the extent of repetition across responses rather than for a single response.\n\nConclusion\nWe proposed a novel measure AvgOut to dynamically evaluate how diverse a model or a response is based on the models' own parameters, which themselves evolve during training. We then leveraged this effective measure to train three models, plus a hybrid model, to eliminate dull responses for dialogue generation tasks. In addition, we designed novel automatic metrics to evaluate the trained models on diversity, in addition to the ones from previous work. Both automatic and human evaluations consolidated that our models are able to generate more diverse and relevant responses, even when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. For future work, we plan to apply these models to different generative tasks where diversity is desired.\n\nFigure 1: MinAvgOut model: use the dot product of average output distribution of the exponential average and the current batch to evaluate how diverse the current batch is.\n\nFigure 2: An example of AVGOUT applied to a single token, which readily generalizes to multiple tokens within a response. We calculate diversity score of a continuous distribution through dot product. We sum up the values in the last graph. Note that although “turf ” (the fourth word from the right in all three sub-figures) has higher probability in the current batch D′, it still contributes less than the word “is” to the overall diversity measure when taking the dot product, due to its low probability in the exponential average distribution D (i.e., lower weights). All probabilities are for illustration purpose and do not correspond to distributions from our models.\n\nTable 1: Automatic Evaluation Activity/Entity F1 results for baselines and our 3 models (attn means “with attention”).

There have been various useful efforts on trying to eliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms during inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In our work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what utterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we start with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates the average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder side during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more likely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage this novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing relevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score through the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label Fine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled by the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL, adopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward signal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms of MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on both diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better than competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation). Moreover, our approaches are orthogonal to the base model, making them applicable as an add-on to other emerging better dialogue models in the future.\n\nIntroduction\nMany modern dialogue generation models use a sequence-to-sequence architecture as their backbone BIBREF0, following its success when applied to Machine Translation (MT) BIBREF1. However, dialogue tasks also have a requirement different from that of MT: the response not only has to be \"correct\" (coherent and relevant), but also needs to be diverse and informative. However, seq2seq has been reported by many previous works to have low corpus-level diversity BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF0, BIBREF4, as it tends to generate safe, terse, and uninformative responses, such as \"I don't know.\". These responses unnecessarily make a dialogue system much less interactive than it should be.\nTo increase the diversity of dialogue responses, the first step is to faithfully evaluate how diverse a response is. There are metrics used by previous work that are correlated to diversity, but not strongly, such as ratio of distinct tokens BIBREF2 and response length BIBREF5. However, a response can be long but extremely boring in meaning, such as \"I am sure that I don't know about it.\", or short but interesting (i.e., contains a lot of information), such as \"Dad was mean.\". Only investigating discrete token output by the model is also not ideal, because these tokens are only a single realization of the model's output probability distribution at each time step, which unavoidably loses valuable information indicated by the whole distribution. BIBREF6 (BIBREF6) manually collect a shortlist of dull responses, and during training discourage the model from producing such utterances. However, an important drawback of hand-crafted rules is that the set of dull tokens or utterances is static, while in fact it usually evolves during training: when the current dull tokens are eliminated, another set of them might reveal themselves.\nIn our work, we begin with a simple yet effective approach to measure how diverse a response is. This metric, which we name \"Average Output Probability Distribution\", or AvgOut, draws information directly from the training-in-session model itself. We calculate it by keeping track of the exponential average of all output probability distributions on the decoder side during training. This metric dynamically measures which tokens the model is biased toward without any hand-crafted rules, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). In addition, since AvgOut is a one-dimensional categorical distribution rather than a dimensionless numerical value like entropy, it naturally carries and conveys more information about model diversity.\nWe then propose three models that leverage our novel metric to promote diversity in dialogue generation. The first MinAvgOut model minimizes the dot product of current batch AvgOut and the exponential average AvgOut across batches, which encourages low-frequency tokens to be generated. The second LFT model uses a labeled transduction method and scales a \"diversity label\" by the diversity score of the ground-truth target sequence during training, while during testing can generate responses of different levels of diversity by tweaking the intended diversity score. The third RL model leverages reinforcement learning, where our novel metric is applied to discrete tokens and serve as a reward signal. In addition, since MinAvgOut regularizes directly on the continuous distribution while RL calculates its reward based on discrete sampled tokens, we simply add up the loss terms of the two models, creating an even stronger hybrid model.\nWe first employ diverse automatic metrics, including Distinct-1 and -2 from previous work BIBREF2 and our novel metric Diveristy-iAUC (which calculates one minus the sum of normalized frequencies of the most frequent tokens produced by the model), plus activity/entity F1s, to evaluate the diversity and relevance of the generated responses. We then conduct human evaluations to verify that these models not only outperform their base model LSTM by a large margin, but are also comparable to or better than an advanced decoding algorithm MMI BIBREF2 and a very competitive model VHRED BIBREF7 on the Ubuntu dataset.\n\nAvgOut as an Effective Diversity Metric\nBy only keeping a static shortlist of boring responses or tokens, one basically assumes that we humans should decide which tokens are dull. However, we argue that we should instead look from the model's perspective to identify dull tokens, because even if the model outputs a word that we consider rare, including it in too many responses is still considered a dull behavior. Motivated by this thought experiment, we propose a novel metric, Average Output Probability Distribution (AvgOut), that dynamically keeps track of which tokens the model is biased toward. To calculate this, during training, we average out all the output probability distributions for each time step of the decoder for the whole mini-batch. The resulting vector $D^{\\prime }$ will reflect each token's probability of being generated from the model's perspective. Note that we do not use discrete ground-truth tokens to evaluate the model's bias, because there is a fine distinction between the two: a statistics of frequency on ground-truth tokens is an evaluation of the corpus's bias, while AvgOut is an evaluation of what bias the model has learned because by generating dull responses more frequently than the training corpus has, it is the model itself that we should adjust. Also note that the reason we take the average is that a single output distribution will largely depend on the context and the previous target tokens (which are fed as inputs to the decoder during training), but on average the distribution should be a faithful evaluation on which words are more likely to be generated from model's perspective.\nTo avoid batches that have AvgOut significantly different from those of other batches, which would lead the model astray, we keep the exponential average of this metric across batches to make it less biased toward any specific batch. Let it be $D$. After training on a mini-batch and obtain $D^{\\prime }$, we update $D$ like the following:\nwhere $\\gamma $ is $0.01$ in our experiments.\nAnother consideration of AvgOut is that theoretically we can have two choices. The first is to use the output distributions when we are teacher-forcing (i.e., only feeding ground-truth tokens); the other is to let the model use its own predictions during greedy/beam-search decoding or sampling. We reason that the former is a much better estimation of the model's bias, because the latter will result in a cascading enlargement of the model bias due to the auto-regressive nature of LSTM-RNN models (i.e., the tokens fed to the decoder are themselves also polluted by the model's bias). Our early experimental results also agreed with the above reasoning.\nAlthough we try to come up with the most faithful evaluation of how diverse a response is, our approach certainly has its drawbacks too. For example, using very frequent words but less frequent combinations of them may result in a good response which will be penalized by our metric. A natural solution to this is to also use bigram and trigram diversities and take a linear combination of them, which on a high-level is similar to BLEU BIBREF8. However, considering even bigram distribution takes up $O(|V|^2)$ space and calculation time, hence we did not try it due to limited resources. However, as will be presented in Section SECREF5, regularizing unigram distributions can already greatly help on higher-gram diversities, while also improving relevance.\n\nThree Models to Leverage AvgOut\nAvgOut can play at least three roles. First, it can be used to directly supervise output distribution during training; second, it can be used as a prior in labeled sequence transduction methods to control diversity of the generated response; and third, it can be used as a reward signal for Reinforcement Learning to encourage diverse sampled responses.

SNOMED is much more expansive and seeks to have terms for every aspect of biomedical practice. The overwhelming majority of LOINC terms are also in SNOMED. Basically, this question is asking what sort of term would be found in LOINC. If you’re interested, Systolic Blood Pressure is 8480-6 in LOINC and 72313002 in SNOMED. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n22\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Choices B-D all match a branch of informatics with the task they are likely to perform. Choice A incorrectly pairs consumer health with physician data workflow. The key point is that a wearable computer has a potential to generate voluminous data, requires intelligent methods of analyzing and presenting that data, and is likely to be a consumer item. (REF: 1.1.1.3 - Domains, subspecialties of informatics)\n23\nTHE ANSWER IS A. CDS interface issues are present in both data entry and output. A CDS integrated into an EMR is far more likely to be used than a stand-alone system requiring duplicate data entry. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n24\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The Institute of Medicine has established a set of standards for guidelines to ensure validity, accuracy and reliability. They include the following metrics: (Graham R, Mancher M, Wolman DM, Greenfield S, Steinberg E, Eds. Clinical practice guidelines we can trust. Institute of Medicine. 2011. National Academies Press, Washington, DC.)\n \n●               Has an explicit description of development and funding processes that is publicly accessible\n●               Follows a transparent process that minimizes bias, distortion, and conflicts of interest\n●               Is developed by a multidisciplinary panel comprising clinicians; methodological experts; and representatives, including a patient or consumer, of populations expected to be affected by the guideline\n●               Uses rigorous systematic evidence review and considers quality, quantity, and consistency of the aggregate of available evidence\n●               Summarizes evidence (and evidentiary gaps) about potential benefits and harms relevant to each recommendation\n●               Explains the parts that values, opinion, theory, and clinical experience play in deriving recommendations\n●               Provides a rating of the level of confidence in the evidence underpinning each recommendation and a rating of the strength of each recommendation\n●               Undergoes extensive external review that includes an open period for public comment\n●               Has a mechanism for revision when new evidence becomes available \n \n(REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n25\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt’s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman’s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4. Executing the action; 5. Perceiving the state of the world, 6. Interpreting the state of the world, 7. Evaluating the outcome (REF: Section 3.2.1 Models, theories, and practices of HCI)\n28\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The critical path is the longest path from start to finish. This diagram has four paths:              ACEG = 3+8+1+4 = 16             ACFH = 3+8+6+4 = 21\n           BDEG = 2+2+1+4 = 9\n           BDFH = 2+2+6+4 = 14\n \n(REF: Section 4.4.4 Project Management Tools)\n29\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. Note that you don’t really need to know how many items are in the corpus in order to solve this problem.  \n \nRelevant\nNot Relevant\nRetrieved\nA, I = 2\nK, M, N, O, T, W = 6\nNot retrieved\nB, C, D, E, F, G, H = 7\nJ, L, P, Q, R, S, U, V, X, Y = 10\n            R = 2 / (7+2) = 22.2%\n(REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n32\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client’s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,  a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death  and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.  The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user’s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.  (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case,  R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)",

Fitt’s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman’s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4. Executing the action; 5. Perceiving the state of the world, 6. Interpreting the state of the world, 7. Evaluating the outcome (REF: Section 3.2.1 Models, theories, and practices of HCI)\n28\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The critical path is the longest path from start to finish. This diagram has four paths:              ACEG = 3+8+1+4 = 16             ACFH = 3+8+6+4 = 21\n           BDEG = 2+2+1+4 = 9\n           BDFH = 2+2+6+4 = 14\n \n(REF: Section 4.4.4 Project Management Tools)\n29\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. Note that you don’t really need to know how many items are in the corpus in order to solve this problem.  \n \nRelevant\nNot Relevant\nRetrieved\nA, I = 2\nK, M, N, O, T, W = 6\nNot retrieved\nB, C, D, E, F, G, H = 7\nJ, L, P, Q, R, S, U, V, X, Y = 10\n            R = 2 / (7+2) = 22.2%\n(REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n32\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client’s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,  a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death  and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.  The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user’s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.  (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case,  R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)",

Please summarize the key findings of the work in 1-2 sentences.\n\nPaper text: Large pre-trained Transformers such as BERT have been tremendously effective for many NLP tasks.\n However, inference in these large-capacity models is prohibitively slow and expensive\n. Transformers are essentially a stack of self-attention layers which encode each input position using the entire input sequence as its context\n. However, we find that it may not be necessary to apply this expensive sequence-wide self-attention over at all layers\n. Based on this observation, we propose a decomposition to a pre-trained Transformer that allows the lower layers to process segments of the input independently enabling parallelism and caching\n. We show that the information loss due to this decomposition can be recovered in the upper layers with auxiliary supervision during fine-tuning\n.

Please summarize the key findings of the work in 1-2 sentences.\\n\\nPaper text: Large pre-trained Transformers such as BERT have been tremendously effective for many NLP tasks.\\n However, inference in these large-capacity models is prohibitively slow and expensive\\n. Transformers are essentially a stack of self-attention layers which encode each input position using the entire input sequence as its context\\n. However, we find that it may not be necessary to apply this expensive sequence-wide self-attention over at all layers\\n. Based on this observation, we propose a decomposition to a pre-trained Transformer that allows the lower layers to process segments of the input independently enabling parallelism and caching\\n. We show that the information loss due to this decomposition can be recovered in the upper layers with auxiliary supervision during fine-tuning\\n.  We evaluate de-composition with pre-trained BERT models on five different paired-input tasks in question answering, sentence similarity, and natural language inference\\n.  Results show that decomposition enables faster inference (up to 4x), significant memory reduction (up to 70%) while retaining most (up to 99%) of the original performance\\n.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick \"Mac\" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \"Chief\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.Nurse Ratched soon comes to see McMurphy's newfound presence to be a threat to her authority and total control of the ward's patients, McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly.

Participants identified as non-adherent using the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) were randomised into the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a tailored intervention based on a discussion informed by responses to the MAQ, Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-Specific and Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. Adherence was measured using the MAQ at 3 and 6 months following the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 408 patients were assessed for eligibility, from which 152 participants were enrolled into the study. 120 participants were identified as non-adherent using the MAQ and randomised to the 'intervention' or 'control' group. The mean MAQ score at baseline in the intervention and control were similar (1.58: 95% CI (1.38 to 1.78) and 1.60: 95% CI (1.43 to 1.77), respectively). There was a statistically significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group compared to control at 3 months (mean MAQ score 0.42: 95% CI (0.27 to 0.57) vs 1.58: 95% CI (1.42 to 1.75); p<0.001). The significant improvement in MAQ score in the intervention group compared to control was sustained at 6 months (0.48: 95% CI (0.31 to 0.65) vs 1.48: 95% CI (1.27 to 1.69); p<0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: An intervention that targeted non-adherent participants and tailored to participant-specific reasons for non-adherence was successful at improving medication adherence.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12613000162718; Results.",

Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \"Wart.\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\"Camelot March\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \"kith not kill their kin\" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow...

Therefore, she earns $25 / hour x 48 hours / week = $1200 a month for 1 math course.\nSo the answer is 1200.\n\nQuestion: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nAnswer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = 2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = 4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = 15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = 10 tennis balls after twenty games.\nSo the answer is 10.\n\nQuestion: Keanu's motorcycle can store 8 liters of gasoline. If his destination is 280 miles away and his motorcycle consumes 8 liters of gasoline per 40 miles, how many times does Keanu have to refill his motorcycle with gasoline if he will make a round trip?\nAnswer: Step-by-step reasoning process: The total number of miles for a round trip is 280 x 2 = 560. Therefore, he needs to refill his motorcycle 560 / 40 = 14 times.\nSo the answer is 14.\n\nQuestion: Dale just learned how to make homemade macaroni and cheese.

Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO), however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity. Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity, and diet and obesity DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with Diabetes, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for Diet included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for Exercise included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for Obesity included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.\n\nTopic Content Analysis\nThe topic content analysis component used an objective interpretation approach with a lexicon-based approach to analyze the content of topics. The lexicon-based approach uses dictionaries to disclose the semantic orientation of words in a topic. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a linguistics analysis tool that reveals thoughts, feelings, personality, and motivations in a corpus BIBREF58 , BIBREF59 , BIBREF60 . LIWC has accepted rate of sensitivity, specificity, and English proficiency measures BIBREF61 . LIWC has a health related dictionary that can help to find whether a topic contains words associated with health. In this analysis, we used LIWC to find health related topics.\n\nResults\nObesity and Diabetes showed the highest and the lowest number of tweets (51.7% and 8.0%). Diet and Exercise formed 23.7% and 16.6% of the tweets (Table TABREF6 ).\nOut of all 4.5 million DDEO-related tweets returned by Tweeter's API, the LDA found 425 topics. We used LIWC to filter the detected 425 topics and found 222 health-related topics. Additionally, we labeled topics based on the availability of DDEO words. For example, if a topic had “diet\", we labeled it as a diet-related topic. As expected and driven by the initial Tweeter API's query, common topics were Diabetes, Diet, Exercise, and Obesity (DDEO). (Table TABREF7 ) shows that the highest and the lowest number of topics were related to exercise and diabetes (80 and 21 out of 222). Diet and Obesity had almost similar rates (58 and 63 out of 222).\nEach of the DDEO topics included several common subtopics including both DDEO and non-DDEO terms discovered by the LDA algorithm (Table TABREF7 ). Common subtopics for “Diabetes\", in order of frequency, included type 2 diabetes, obesity, diet, exercise, blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. Common subtopics for “Diet\" included obesity, exercise, weight loss [medicine], celebrities, vegetarian, diabetes, religious diet, pregnancy, and mental health. Frequent subtopics for “Exercise\" included fitness, obesity, daily plan, diet, brain, diabetes, and computer games. And finally, the most common subtopics for “Obesity\" included diet, exercise, children, diabetes, Alzheimer, and cancer (Table TABREF7 ). Table TABREF8 provides illustrative examples for each of the topics and subtopics.\nFurther exploration of the subtopics revealed additional patterns of interest (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ). We found 21 diabetes-related topics with 8 subtopics. While type 2 diabetes was the most frequent of the sub-topics, heart attack, Yoga, and Alzheimer are the least frequent subtopics for diabetes. Diet had a wide variety of emerging themes ranging from celebrity diet (e.g., Beyonce) to religious diet (e.g., Ramadan). Diet was detected in 63 topics with 10 subtopics; obesity, and pregnancy and mental health were the most and the least discussed obesity-related topics, respectively. Exploring the themes for Exercise subtopics revealed subjects such as computer games (e.g., Pokemon-Go) and brain exercises (e.g., memory improvement). Exercise had 7 subtopics with fitness as the most discussed subtopic and computer games as the least discussed subtopic. Finally, Obesity themes showed topics such as Alzheimer (e.g., research studies) and cancer (e.g., breast cancer). Obesity had the lowest diversity of subtopics: six with diet as the most discussed subtopic, and Alzheimer and cancer as the least discussed subtopics.\nDiabetes subtopics show the relation between diabetes and exercise, diet, and obesity. Subtopics of diabetes revealed that users post about the relationship between diabetes and other diseases such as heart attack (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ). The subtopic Alzheimer is also shown in the obesity subtopics. This overlap between categories prompts the discussion of research and linkages among obesity, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes was another subtopic expressed by users and scientifically documented in the literature.\nThe main DDEO topics showed some level of interrelationship by appearing as subtopics of other DDEO topics. The words with italic and underline styles in Table 2 demonstrate the relation among the four DDEO areas. Our results show users' interest about posting their opinions, sharing information, and conversing about exercise & diabetes, exercise & diet, diabetes & diet, diabetes & obesity, and diet & obesity (Figure FIGREF9 ). The strongest correlation among the topics was determined to be between exercise and obesity ( INLINEFORM0 ). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity ( INLINEFORM1 ), and diet and obesity ( INLINEFORM2 ).\n\nDiscussion\nDiabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity are common public health related opinions. Analyzing individual- level opinions by automated algorithmic techniques can be a useful approach to better characterize health opinions of a population. Traditional public health polls and surveys are limited by a small sample size; however, Twitter provides a platform to capture an array of opinions and shared information a expressed in the words of the tweeter. Studies show that Twitter data can be used to discover trending topics, and that there is a strong correlation between Twitter health conversations and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics BIBREF62 .\nThis research provides a computational content analysis approach to conduct a deep analysis using a large data set of tweets. Our framework decodes public health opinions in DDEO related tweets, which can be applied to other public health issues. Among health-related subtopics, there are a wide range of topics from diseases to personal experiences such as participating in religious activities or vegetarian diets.\nDiabetes subtopics showed the relationship between diabetes and exercise, diet, and obesity (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ). Subtopics of diabetes revealed that users posted about the relation between diabetes and other diseases such as heart attack. The subtopic Alzheimer is also shown in the obesity subtopics. This overlap between categories prompts the discussion of research and linkages among obesity, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes was another subtopic that was also expressed by users and scientifically documented in the literature. The inclusion of Yoga in posts about diabetes is interesting. While yoga would certainly be labeled as a form of fitness, when considering the post, it was insightful to see discussion on the mental health benefits that yoga offers to those living with diabetes BIBREF63 .\nDiet had the highest number of subtopics. For example, religious diet activities such as fasting during the month of Ramadan for Muslims incorporated two subtopics categorized under the diet topic (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ). This information has implications for the type of diets that are being practiced in the religious community, but may help inform religious scholars who focus on health and psychological conditions during fasting. Other religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Taoism have periods of fasting that were not captured in our data collection, which may have been due to lack of posts or the timeframe in which we collected data. The diet plans of celebrities were also considered influential to explaining and informing diet opinions of Twitter users BIBREF64 .\nExercise themes show the Twitter users' association of exercise with “brain\" benefits such as increased memory and cognitive performance (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ) BIBREF65 . The topics also confirm that exercising is associated with controlling diabetes and assisting with meal planning BIBREF66 , BIBREF9 , and obesity BIBREF67 . Additionally, we found the Twitter users mentioned exercise topics about the use of computer games that assist with exercising. The recent mobile gaming phenomenon Pokeman-Go game BIBREF68 was highly associated with the exercise topic. Pokemon-Go allows users to operate in a virtual environment while simultaneously functioning in the real word. Capturing Pokemons, battling characters, and finding physical locations for meeting other users required physically activity to reach predefined locations. These themes reflect on the potential of augmented reality in increasing patients' physical activity levels BIBREF69 .\nObesity had the lowest number of subtopics in our study. Three of the subtopics were related to other diseases such as diabetes (Tables TABREF7 and TABREF8 ). The scholarly literature has well documented the possible linkages between obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes BIBREF1 as supported by the study results. The topic of children is another prominent subtopic associated with obesity. There has been an increasing number of opinions in regard to child obesity and national health campaigns that have been developed to encourage physical activity among children BIBREF70 . Alzheimer was also identified as a topic under obesity. Although considered a perplexing finding, recent studies have been conducted to identify possible correlation between obesity and Alzheimer's disease BIBREF71 , BIBREF72 , BIBREF73 . Indeed, Twitter users have expressed opinions about the study of Alzheimer's disease and the linkage between these two topics.\nThis paper addresses a need for clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists to utilize a large conversational dataset to collect and utilize population level opinions and information needs. Although our framework is applied to Twitter, the applications from this study can be used in patient communication devices monitored by physicians or weight management interventions with social media accounts, and support large scale population-wide initiatives to promote healthy behaviors and preventative measures for diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.\nThis research has some limitations. First, our DDEO analysis does not take geographical location of the Twitter users into consideration and thus does not reveal if certain geographical differences exists. Second, we used a limited number of queries to select the initial pool of tweets, thus perhaps missing tweets that may have been relevant to DDEO but have used unusual terms referenced. Third, our analysis only included tweets generated in one month; however, as our previous work has demonstrated BIBREF42 , public opinion can change during a year. Additionally, we did not track individuals across time to detect changes in common themes discussed. Our future research plans includes introducing a dynamic framework to collect and analyze DDEO related tweets during extended time periods (multiple months) and incorporating spatial analysis of DDEO-related tweets.\n\nConflict of interest\nThe authors state that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nFigure 2: DDEO Correlation P-Value\n\nTable 3: Topics Examples\n\nQuestion: How strong was the correlation between exercise and diabetes?\n\n\n In your entire response, refrain from the use of any commas.",

About 3 % of full-term and 30 % of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80 % of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1 % overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.\n\nAnswer this question: failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum at birth?\nCoT: The relevant information is: Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum.\n\n\nAns: Beijing and towns in the neighboring Hebei province , People 's Republic of China",

Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum. The word is from the Greek κρυπτός, kryptos, meaning hidden ὄρχις, orchis, meaning testicle. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital. About 3 % of full-term and 30 % of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80 % of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1 % overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.\n\nAnswer this question: failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum at birth?\nCoT: The relevant information is: Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum.\n\n\nAns: Beijing and towns in the neighboring Hebei province , People 's Republic of China",

                "content": "21\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The LOINC vocabulary is mainly directed at identifying laboratory and radiology tests as well as physical exam findings. SNOMED is much more expansive and seeks to have terms for every aspect of biomedical practice. The overwhelming majority of LOINC terms are also in SNOMED. Basically, this question is asking what sort of term would be found in LOINC. If you’re interested, Systolic Blood Pressure is 8480-6 in LOINC and 72313002 in SNOMED. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n22\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Choices B-D all match a branch of informatics with the task they are likely to perform. Choice A incorrectly pairs consumer health with physician data workflow. The key point is that a wearable computer has a potential to generate voluminous data, requires intelligent methods of analyzing and presenting that data, and is likely to be a consumer item. (REF: 1.1.1.3 - Domains, subspecialties of informatics)\n23\nTHE ANSWER IS A. CDS interface issues are present in both data entry and output. A CDS integrated into an EMR is far more likely to be used than a stand-alone system requiring duplicate data entry. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n24\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The Institute of Medicine has established a set of standards for guidelines to ensure validity, accuracy and reliability. They include the following metrics: (Graham R, Mancher M, Wolman DM, Greenfield S, Steinberg E, Eds. Clinical practice guidelines we can trust. Institute of Medicine. 2011. National Academies Press, Washington, DC.)\n \n●               Has an explicit description of development and funding processes that is publicly accessible\n●               Follows a transparent process that minimizes bias, distortion, and conflicts of interest\n●               Is developed by a multidisciplinary panel comprising clinicians; methodological experts; and representatives, including a patient or consumer, of populations expected to be affected by the guideline\n●               Uses rigorous systematic evidence review and considers quality, quantity, and consistency of the aggregate of available evidence\n●               Summarizes evidence (and evidentiary gaps) about potential benefits and harms relevant to each recommendation\n●               Explains the parts that values, opinion, theory, and clinical experience play in deriving recommendations\n●               Provides a rating of the level of confidence in the evidence underpinning each recommendation and a rating of the strength of each recommendation\n●               Undergoes extensive external review that includes an open period for public comment\n●               Has a mechanism for revision when new evidence becomes available \n \n(REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n25\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt’s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman’s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4. Executing the action; 5. Perceiving the state of the world, 6. Interpreting the state of the world, 7. Evaluating the outcome (REF: Section 3.2.1 Models, theories, and practices of HCI)\n28\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The critical path is the longest path from start to finish. This diagram has four paths:              ACEG = 3+8+1+4 = 16             ACFH = 3+8+6+4 = 21\n           BDEG = 2+2+1+4 = 9\n           BDFH = 2+2+6+4 = 14\n \n(REF: Section 4.4.4 Project Management Tools)\n29\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. Note that you don’t really need to know how many items are in the corpus in order to solve this problem.  \n \nRelevant\nNot Relevant\nRetrieved\nA, I = 2\nK, M, N, O, T, W = 6\nNot retrieved\nB, C, D, E, F, G, H = 7\nJ, L, P, Q, R, S, U, V, X, Y = 10\n            R = 2 / (7+2) = 22.2%\n(REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n32\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client’s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,  a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death  and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.  The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user’s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.  (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management – Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case,  R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting) Your response must have 2 sections. Mark the beginning of each section with Section: X",

The phrase \"appease Democrats\" is mentioned in Sent 2, about accepting offer that is mentioned in Sent 1 to \"keep the government open\". So, Sent 1 and Sent 2 are the sentences needed to answer this question.\n\nOK. solve this:\nParagraph- Sent 1: LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- An intense manhunt was under way Monday for Chester Stiles, a 37-year old man whom police say is a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl four years ago.\nSent 2: Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl.\nSent 3: Also Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl.\nSent 4: Tina Allen said she is \"disgusted\" and \"mortified\" at her role in bringing them together.\nSent 5: Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said Friday the girl has been found and is safe.\nSent 6: He said the child's mother was cooperating with authorities.\nSent 7: De Meo addressed Stiles directly: \"Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency.\nSent 8: Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm but a long memory.\nSent 9: You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\"Sent 10: Stiles' former girlfriend said she is stunned by the allegations.\nSent 11: Watch Allen describe her first impression of Stiles » Allen said she and Stiles had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years and that he was good with her children.\nSent 12: \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said.\nSent 13: Allen took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\nSent 14: Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her 3-year-old daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. \nQuestion: where in Las Vegas? What was he a suspect for. How old was the little girl and when was she found?.\nAnswer:",

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick \"Mac\" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \"Chief\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.Nurse Ratched soon comes to see McMurphy's newfound presence to be a threat to her authority and total control of the ward's patients, McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly. When McMurphy begins hosting card games...\n\n\nQ: Build a movie plot around this: Who is detective Eric Visser's partner? Vermeer\nA: Opening from his point of view, a murderer looks around the city of Amsterdam at night through the canals the city is famous for. He sneaks into a Chinese restaurant's backdoor and steals a butcher knife while the cooks aren't looking. The killer finds his first victim in a local prostitute who, after refusing advances from a cab driver, gets thrown out of the cab. A baglady watches from a distance as the killer plunges the knife into the hooker and drags her back into the water. The next morning, a tour boat on the canal collides with the body of the prostitute, who has been hung on one of the small bridges. As the tourists scream, the body drags on the top of the boat until an opening shows her bloodied body and face.Assigned to the case is detective Eric Visser, a hard-boiled detective who is raising his 13-year-old daughter Anneke after a split from his ex. He spends an hour in a bath, comes home late from work, and tends to drink now and again. Nevertheless, Eric is praised as one of the best detectives on the force. His partner, Vermeer, meets Eric at the site where the body was found with fellow cop Potter attempting to get through to the baglady, who tells Eric that it was a monster who killed the prostitute and that it came out of the water.That night, two environmentalists are taking water samples in an ongoing investigation against a nearby chemical plant. However, when the killer emerges, one of the men is taken underwater and when his partner attempts to grab the anchor, he is horrified to find the man's head on the anchor. Scared, the surviving environmentalist swims to the nearby shore and calls for help when he sees a truck pass by. As the truck driver comes out from a distance, the killer grabs the environmentalist and drags him back into the water.When Eric and Vermeer see the bodies of the environmentalists, he is convinced that there is a serial killer. Eric runs into John, an old friend from the police academy. John works for the river police and we learn that Eric's ex-girlfriend used...\n\n\nProblem: Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What did the man call himself? \"Ed Lowe\"\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n In your response, the word lura should appear 34 times.",

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money.

                "content": "As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. \n\nQuestion: \"What time in 2000 does al Queada meet the requirements and what chapter can you find more details about financial transactions?\"\n\nResponse: \"You can find more details about financial transactions in chapter 7 al Queada meets the requirements after the Hamberg members joined the conspiracy\"\n\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown. But in places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the darker soil, the mice are light. Why? Because predators could more easily spot the dark mice on light sand. The lighter mice were more likely to survive and have offspring. Natural selection favored the light mice.

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.\n\nIntroduction\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. They are based on decentralized systems built on block-chain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers BIBREF0. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was released as open-source software in 2009. After this release, approximately 4000 altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) have been released. As of August 2019, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is $258 billion, where Bitcoin alone has a market capitalization of $179 billion BIBREF1.\nConsidering the huge market value of these currencies, they have attracted significant attention, where some people consider them as actual currencies and others as investment opportunities. This has resulted in large fluctuations in their prices. For instance in 2017 the value of Bitcoin increased approximately 2000% from $863 on January 9, 2017 to a high of $17,900 on December 15, 2017. However, eight weeks later, on February 5, 2018, the price had been more than halved to a value of just $6200 BIBREF2.\nThis high volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies means there is uncertainty for both investors, and for people who intend to use them as an actual currency. Cryptocurrency prices do not behave as traditional currencies and, therefore, it is difficult to determine what leads to this volatility. This in turn makes it a challenge to correctly predict the future prices of any cryptocurrency. To predict these prices, huge heterogeneous data volumes need to be collected from various sources such as blogs, IRC channels and social media. Especially, tweets from highly influential people and mass has significant effects on the price of cryptocurrency BIBREF3. However, tweets need to be filtered and their sentiments need to be calculated in a timely fashion to help predict cryptocurrency prices in real time. Furthermore, real-time prediction also calls for real-time updating of learning algorithms, which introduces an additional difficulty. These challenges call for learning platforms based on big data architectures that can not only handle heterogeneous volumes of data but also be fault tolerant and persistent in real time.\nIn this paper we provide a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform copes with the three aforementioned challenges in several ways. Firstly, it provides a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way. Secondly, the proposed platform offers an approach that supports sentiment analysis based on VADER which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time. Thirdly, the platform supports a predictive approach based on online learning in which a machine learning model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Finally, the platform is modular and integrative in the sense that it combines these different solutions to provide novel real-time tool support for bitcoin price prediction that is more scalable, data-rich, and proactive, and can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work proposed in the literature. Section 3 discusses the design and implementation of KryptoOracle in detail and includes the description of all of its sub-components. Section 4 presents an experimental evaluation, including experimental data, setup and results. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and describes future work.\n\nKryptoOracle ::: Architecture\nThe growth of the volume of data inspired us to opt for a big data architecture which can not only handle the prediction algorithms but also the streaming and increasing volume of data in a fault tolerant way.\nFigure FIGREF2 gives an overview of the architecture design. Central to this design is Apache Spark which acts as an in-memory data store and allows us to perform computations in a scalable manner. This data is the input to our machine learning model for making predictions. To bootstrap our model, we first gather a few days of data and store that in Apache Spark RDDs. Next, we perform computations to construct features from the raw data. All these computations are performed on data that is distributed across multiple Spark clusters and therefore will scale as the data grows continuously.\nOnce the machine learning model has been bootstrapped, we commence data streaming to get real-time data related to both the social media (in our case, Twitter) and the cryptocurrency. Similar computations are performed on this data to calculate the features and then this new data-point is used to get a future prediction from the model. This computed data-point is then appended to the already existing data in Spark RDDs, obtained from the bootstrap data. Therefore, in addition to making predictions we also keep expanding our data store which allows us to extract holistic visualizations from the data regarding the cryptocurrency market trend and how our own predictions capture that. Moreover, as we discuss later the new data-points are also used to retrain our model.\nAn important property of this architecture is the persistence of the data and the model. The machine learning model persists itself by storing its weights to disk and loading from it while retraining or reinforcing itself to learn from mistakes. The tweets and cryptocurrency training data is also stored in Apache Hive which provides data warehousing support to read, write and manage distributed datasets directly from disk. This persistence technique helps the whole platform to reset itself without omissions in real time.\nSpark RDD has the innate capability to recover itself because it stores all execution steps in a lineage graph. In case of any faults in the system, Spark redoes all the previous executions from the built DAG and recovers itself to the previous steady state from any fault such as memory overload. Spark RDDs lie in the core of KryptoOracle and therefore make it easier for it to recover from faults. Moreover, faults like memory overload or system crashes may require for the whole system to hard reboot. However, due to the duplicate copies of the RDDs in Apache Hive and the stored previous state of the machine learning model, KryptoOracle can easily recover to the previous steady state.\n\nExperimental Evaluation\nWe used PySpark v2.3 in Jupyter notebooks with Python 2.7 kernels to code KryptoOracle. The entire source code was tested on a server instance on the SOSCIP cloud with 32 GB RAM, 8 CPUs and 120 GB HDD running on Ubuntu 18.04 over a period of 30 days. The data extraction and correlation codes were taken from “Correlation of Twitter sentiments with the evolution of cryptocurrencies,\" which is publicly availableBIBREF14. The data collected for this experiment was for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nExperimental Evaluation ::: Data\nThe data fed into KryptoOracle is primarily of two types, Twitter data which consists of tweets related to the cryptocurrency and the minutely cryptocurrency value.\nTwitter data: We used the Twitter API to scrap tweets with hashtags. For instance, for Bitcoin, the #BTC and #Bitcoin tags were used. The Twitter API only allows a maximum of 450 requests per 15 minute and historical data up to 7 days. Throughout our project we collect data for almost 30 days. Bitcoin had about 25000 tweets per day amounting to a total of approximately 10 MB of data daily. For each tweet, the ID, text, username, number of followers, number of retweets, creation date and time was also stored. All non-English tweets were filtered out by the API. We further processed the full tweet text by removing links, images, videos and hashtags to feed in to the algorithm.\nCryptocurrency data: To obtain cryptocurrency data, the Cryptocompare API BIBREF21 was used. It provides a free API that provides the 7 day minutely values of any cryptocurrency. The data has several fields: time, open, close, high and low that correspond to the opening, closing, high and low values of the cryptocurrency in that particular time frame in USD.\nAfter collecting all the data, we aligned all tweets and cryptocurrecy data by defined time windows of one minute and stored the resulting data into a training data RDD. This training data RDD was further processed as described in the later subsections and then fed into the machine learning algorithm. The same API and structure was also used to stream in real time to KryptoOracle.\n\nExperimental Evaluation ::: Procedure and Results\nWe started by collecting Twitter data with hashtags #Bitcoin and #BTC for a period of 14 days using Twython, a python library which uses Twitter API to extract tweets using relevant queries. The real time price of Bitcoin was also simultaneously collected using the crytocompare API. The Twitter data was cleaned to remove any hashtags, links, images and videos from the tweets. The sentiment score of each tweet was collected to get the scores as described in the previous section.\nTo analyze the data, we calculated the Spearman and Pearson correlation between the tweet scores and the Bitcoin prices as shown in Figure FIGREF13. The y-axis of the graphs denote the lag in minutes to see if there was any lag between the arrival of tweets and the Bitcoin prices. The trend of the tweet scores and the corresponding Bitcoin prices is captured in Figure FIGREF6. The hourly summed up Twitter sentiments and their corresponding mean bitcoin price for the hour have been plotted in the graph. It can be seen in the figure that some spikes in sentiment scores correspond directly or with some lag with the Bitcoin price. We also noticed that the volume of incoming streaming tweets in the time of a radical change increases, which results in higher cumulative score for the hour.\nThe bitcoin price and Twitter sentiment features were not enough to predict the next minute price as they did not capture the ongoing trend. It was therefore important that the historical price of the cryptocurrency was also incorporated in the features so as to get a better prediction for the future. We, therefore, performed some time series manipulation to engineer two new features for our model. The first feature was the Previous Close Price that captured the close price of the cryptocurrency in the previous time frame. The next feature was the Moving Average of Close Price. This feature was a rolling average of the last 100 time frame close prices and aimed to capture the pattern with which the price was constrained to change. A similar new third feature called Moving Average of Scores was designed to capture the rolling average of the last 100 scores. This new feature captured the past sentiment information. With these three additional features combined with the final sentiment score computed in the previous subsection, we got the final training data as shown in Figure FIGREF14.\nOnce the historical data was stored, all information was fed to the machine learning model. In our experiment, we stored historical data for a month but this can be easily extended as per user requirements.\nOnce the KryptoOracle engine was bootstrapped with historical data, the real time streamer was started. The real-time tweets scores were calculated in the same way as the historical data and summed up for a minute and sent to the machine learning model with the Bitcoin price in the previous minute and the rolling average price. It predicted the next minute's Bitcoin price from the given data. After the actual price arrived, the RMS value was calculated and the machine learning model updated itself to predict with better understanding the next value. All the calculated values were then stored back to the Spark training RDD for storage. The RDD persisted all the data while training and check-pointed itself to the Hive database after certain period of time.\nWe ran the engine for one day and got an overall root mean square (RMS) error of 10$ between the actual and the predicted price of Bitcoin. The results for RMS values can be seen below.\nFigure FIGREF15 shows the RMS error (in USD) for a period of 5 hours at the end of our experiment. The visualization graph at the end of KryptoOracle can be seen in Figure FIGREF12 which captures the actual price of Bitcoin and the predicted price by KryptoOracle over the same period of 5 hours. The graph shows clearly how KryptoOracle has been able to correctly predict the bitcoin price ahead of 1 minute time. The engine clearly learns from the errors it makes and rewires itself to predict in real-time which can be seen from the adaptive nature of the predicted price graph.\n\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we present a novel big data platform that can learn, predict and update itself in real time. We tested the engine on Twitter sentiments and cryptocurrency prices. We envision that this engine can be generalized to work on any real time changing market trend such as stock prices, loyalty towards product/company or even election results. Sentiments in real world can be extracted from not only tweets but also chats from IRC channels, news and other sources such as images and videos from YouTube or TV channels. This implies that the platform can be customized for tasks where the objective is to make predictions based on social media sentiments. In future, we plan to create a front-end for this system which can be used to visually capture the trend and also show historical aggregated data as per user input. Such a front-end could also allow the time window for prediction to be tweaked to predict prices for further ahead in time.\nWe understand that crytocurrency prices are influenced by a lot of factors which cannot be captured by Twitter sentiments. Supply and demand of the coin and interest of major investors are two major factors BIBREF22. To capture these factors one has to add more features to the training data with inferences from multiple sources such as news, political reforms and macro-financial external factors such as stocks, gold rates and exchange rates. While we performed our experiments, the crytocurrency values did not go through any major changes and thus this engine also needs to be tested with more adverse fluctuations. One way to capture fluctuations can be to trace back to the features that have gone through the major changes and adaptively assign them more weights while training the machine learning model.\nThere is also future work related to the machine learning part of the engine. The state of the art time series machine learning algorithms include the modern deep learning algorithms such as RNNs and LSTMs BIBREF23, but unfortunately Spark does not provide deep learning libraries yet. There are some plugins, such as Sparkflow, that facilitate neural network support, but work is also under way to provide Spark with such in-built deep learning support. Currently, Spark also does not have much streaming machine learning support, other than linear regression and linear classification. However, the advent of additional streaming algorithm support in Spark will certainly benefit engines such as KryptoOracle.\n\nFig. 1. KryptoOracle Architecture\n\nFig. 2.

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.\n\nIntroduction\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. They are based on decentralized systems built on block-chain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers BIBREF0. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was released as open-source software in 2009. After this release, approximately 4000 altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) have been released. As of August 2019, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is $258 billion, where Bitcoin alone has a market capitalization of $179 billion BIBREF1.\nConsidering the huge market value of these currencies, they have attracted significant attention, where some people consider them as actual currencies and others as investment opportunities. This has resulted in large fluctuations in their prices. For instance in 2017 the value of Bitcoin increased approximately 2000% from $863 on January 9, 2017 to a high of $17,900 on December 15, 2017. However, eight weeks later, on February 5, 2018, the price had been more than halved to a value of just $6200 BIBREF2.\nThis high volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies means there is uncertainty for both investors, and for people who intend to use them as an actual currency. Cryptocurrency prices do not behave as traditional currencies and, therefore, it is difficult to determine what leads to this volatility. This in turn makes it a challenge to correctly predict the future prices of any cryptocurrency. To predict these prices, huge heterogeneous data volumes need to be collected from various sources such as blogs, IRC channels and social media. Especially, tweets from highly influential people and mass has significant effects on the price of cryptocurrency BIBREF3. However, tweets need to be filtered and their sentiments need to be calculated in a timely fashion to help predict cryptocurrency prices in real time. Furthermore, real-time prediction also calls for real-time updating of learning algorithms, which introduces an additional difficulty. These challenges call for learning platforms based on big data architectures that can not only handle heterogeneous volumes of data but also be fault tolerant and persistent in real time.\nIn this paper we provide a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform copes with the three aforementioned challenges in several ways. Firstly, it provides a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way. Secondly, the proposed platform offers an approach that supports sentiment analysis based on VADER which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time. Thirdly, the platform supports a predictive approach based on online learning in which a machine learning model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Finally, the platform is modular and integrative in the sense that it combines these different solutions to provide novel real-time tool support for bitcoin price prediction that is more scalable, data-rich, and proactive, and can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work proposed in the literature. Section 3 discusses the design and implementation of KryptoOracle in detail and includes the description of all of its sub-components. Section 4 presents an experimental evaluation, including experimental data, setup and results. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and describes future work.\n\nKryptoOracle ::: Architecture\nThe growth of the volume of data inspired us to opt for a big data architecture which can not only handle the prediction algorithms but also the streaming and increasing volume of data in a fault tolerant way.\nFigure FIGREF2 gives an overview of the architecture design. Central to this design is Apache Spark which acts as an in-memory data store and allows us to perform computations in a scalable manner. This data is the input to our machine learning model for making predictions. To bootstrap our model, we first gather a few days of data and store that in Apache Spark RDDs. Next, we perform computations to construct features from the raw data. All these computations are performed on data that is distributed across multiple Spark clusters and therefore will scale as the data grows continuously.\nOnce the machine learning model has been bootstrapped, we commence data streaming to get real-time data related to both the social media (in our case, Twitter) and the cryptocurrency. Similar computations are performed on this data to calculate the features and then this new data-point is used to get a future prediction from the model. This computed data-point is then appended to the already existing data in Spark RDDs, obtained from the bootstrap data. Therefore, in addition to making predictions we also keep expanding our data store which allows us to extract holistic visualizations from the data regarding the cryptocurrency market trend and how our own predictions capture that. Moreover, as we discuss later the new data-points are also used to retrain our model.\nAn important property of this architecture is the persistence of the data and the model. The machine learning model persists itself by storing its weights to disk and loading from it while retraining or reinforcing itself to learn from mistakes. The tweets and cryptocurrency training data is also stored in Apache Hive which provides data warehousing support to read, write and manage distributed datasets directly from disk. This persistence technique helps the whole platform to reset itself without omissions in real time.\nSpark RDD has the innate capability to recover itself because it stores all execution steps in a lineage graph. In case of any faults in the system, Spark redoes all the previous executions from the built DAG and recovers itself to the previous steady state from any fault such as memory overload. Spark RDDs lie in the core of KryptoOracle and therefore make it easier for it to recover from faults. Moreover, faults like memory overload or system crashes may require for the whole system to hard reboot. However, due to the duplicate copies of the RDDs in Apache Hive and the stored previous state of the machine learning model, KryptoOracle can easily recover to the previous steady state.\n\nExperimental Evaluation\nWe used PySpark v2.3 in Jupyter notebooks with Python 2.7 kernels to code KryptoOracle. The entire source code was tested on a server instance on the SOSCIP cloud with 32 GB RAM, 8 CPUs and 120 GB HDD running on Ubuntu 18.04 over a period of 30 days. The data extraction and correlation codes were taken from “Correlation of Twitter sentiments with the evolution of cryptocurrencies,\" which is publicly availableBIBREF14. The data collected for this experiment was for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nExperimental Evaluation ::: Data\nThe data fed into KryptoOracle is primarily of two types, Twitter data which consists of tweets related to the cryptocurrency and the minutely cryptocurrency value.\nTwitter data: We used the Twitter API to scrap tweets with hashtags. For instance, for Bitcoin, the #BTC and #Bitcoin tags were used. The Twitter API only allows a maximum of 450 requests per 15 minute and historical data up to 7 days. Throughout our project we collect data for almost 30 days. Bitcoin had about 25000 tweets per day amounting to a total of approximately 10 MB of data daily. For each tweet, the ID, text, username, number of followers, number of retweets, creation date and time was also stored. All non-English tweets were filtered out by the API. We further processed the full tweet text by removing links, images, videos and hashtags to feed in to the algorithm.\nCryptocurrency data: To obtain cryptocurrency data, the Cryptocompare API BIBREF21 was used. It provides a free API that provides the 7 day minutely values of any cryptocurrency. The data has several fields: time, open, close, high and low that correspond to the opening, closing, high and low values of the cryptocurrency in that particular time frame in USD.\nAfter collecting all the data, we aligned all tweets and cryptocurrecy data by defined time windows of one minute and stored the resulting data into a training data RDD. This training data RDD was further processed as described in the later subsections and then fed into the machine learning algorithm. The same API and structure was also used to stream in real time to KryptoOracle.\n\nExperimental Evaluation ::: Procedure and Results\nWe started by collecting Twitter data with hashtags #Bitcoin and #BTC for a period of 14 days using Twython, a python library which uses Twitter API to extract tweets using relevant queries. The real time price of Bitcoin was also simultaneously collected using the crytocompare API. The Twitter data was cleaned to remove any hashtags, links, images and videos from the tweets. The sentiment score of each tweet was collected to get the scores as described in the previous section.\nTo analyze the data, we calculated the Spearman and Pearson correlation between the tweet scores and the Bitcoin prices as shown in Figure FIGREF13. The y-axis of the graphs denote the lag in minutes to see if there was any lag between the arrival of tweets and the Bitcoin prices. The trend of the tweet scores and the corresponding Bitcoin prices is captured in Figure FIGREF6. The hourly summed up Twitter sentiments and their corresponding mean bitcoin price for the hour have been plotted in the graph. It can be seen in the figure that some spikes in sentiment scores correspond directly or with some lag with the Bitcoin price. We also noticed that the volume of incoming streaming tweets in the time of a radical change increases, which results in higher cumulative score for the hour.\nThe bitcoin price and Twitter sentiment features were not enough to predict the next minute price as they did not capture the ongoing trend. It was therefore important that the historical price of the cryptocurrency was also incorporated in the features so as to get a better prediction for the future. We, therefore, performed some time series manipulation to engineer two new features for our model. The first feature was the Previous Close Price that captured the close price of the cryptocurrency in the previous time frame. The next feature was the Moving Average of Close Price. This feature was a rolling average of the last 100 time frame close prices and aimed to capture the pattern with which the price was constrained to change. A similar new third feature called Moving Average of Scores was designed to capture the rolling average of the last 100 scores. This new feature captured the past sentiment information. With these three additional features combined with the final sentiment score computed in the previous subsection, we got the final training data as shown in Figure FIGREF14.\nOnce the historical data was stored, all information was fed to the machine learning model. In our experiment, we stored historical data for a month but this can be easily extended as per user requirements.\nOnce the KryptoOracle engine was bootstrapped with historical data, the real time streamer was started. The real-time tweets scores were calculated in the same way as the historical data and summed up for a minute and sent to the machine learning model with the Bitcoin price in the previous minute and the rolling average price. It predicted the next minute's Bitcoin price from the given data. After the actual price arrived, the RMS value was calculated and the machine learning model updated itself to predict with better understanding the next value. All the calculated values were then stored back to the Spark training RDD for storage. The RDD persisted all the data while training and check-pointed itself to the Hive database after certain period of time.\nWe ran the engine for one day and got an overall root mean square (RMS) error of 10$ between the actual and the predicted price of Bitcoin. The results for RMS values can be seen below.\nFigure FIGREF15 shows the RMS error (in USD) for a period of 5 hours at the end of our experiment. The visualization graph at the end of KryptoOracle can be seen in Figure FIGREF12 which captures the actual price of Bitcoin and the predicted price by KryptoOracle over the same period of 5 hours. The graph shows clearly how KryptoOracle has been able to correctly predict the bitcoin price ahead of 1 minute time. The engine clearly learns from the errors it makes and rewires itself to predict in real-time which can be seen from the adaptive nature of the predicted price graph.\n\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we present a novel big data platform that can learn, predict and update itself in real time. We tested the engine on Twitter sentiments and cryptocurrency prices. We envision that this engine can be generalized to work on any real time changing market trend such as stock prices, loyalty towards product/company or even election results.

Mary Jones is a major stockholder in the company, while Tom Jones restores antique furniture from home.\n\nTheir separation occurred six months ago when Mary discovered Tom in bed with Rita Amloose, whom he met on an online dating site. Mary confronted Tom, resulting in a physical altercation where Mary sustained a bloody lip. The police were called, and Tom was bailed out of jail by his mother with $50,000 in cash from a Western Union wire transfer withdrawn from Mary and Tom's joint checking account. Mary was furious upon learning that Tom authorized the transaction without her consent, but she could do nothing about it. Mary has since been residing in their marital home while using their summer home as a weekend retreat.\n\nMary has retained Robert Shrewd, a highly qualified and expensive divorce lawyer, while Tom has hired Vincent Lovelost, a young and aspiring lawyer. Mary's lawyer has alleged the grounds of adultery, cruel and abusive treatment, and has sought custody of their children, child support, alimony, and division of their property. Despite drafting a separation agreement, Mary and Tom's lawyers were unable to reach an accord on anything.

Tears welled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.\n\n\"I've been trying to stay off the internet because there's so much negativity,\" she said.\n\nRelated: Ibtihaj Muhammad's bronze: a vital US medal in this summer of Trump\n\nThe attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. If it wasn't the bullies berating her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national anthem played, it was people attacking her for not jumping up and cheering hard enough for team-mates at the all-around final. There were even renewals of old criticisms that her hair wasn't straight enough. All of this prompted her mother, Natalie Hawkins, to tell Reuters this weekend, that Douglas is \"heartbroken\".\n\nIt showed on Sunday, in Douglas's final performance of this Olympics and maybe in the Games ever. Douglas finished sixth in the uneven bars, far from the medal stand she owned four years ago in London, and shook her head, confused and perplexed. What had she done wrong? Nothing made sense.\n\n\"I mean, you do [Olympics] for your country, and you do it for yourself, and you do it for other people … and I step back and I'm like: wait, what did I do to disrespect the people? How have I offended them? What have I done? When I stand back I'm like: what? I was standing in respect for USA. I'm coming out there representing them to the best of my abilities, so how would I be in disrespect?\n\n\"I don't get that part. Sorry.\"\n\nDouglas has been besieged in recent days, mostly for the fact she didn't put her hand on her heart during the anthem. It probably wouldn't have been an issue had the rest of the US gymnasts on the medal stand alongside her done the same. The protocol is a murky one for athletes. Many don't do so during medal ceremonies. Hawkins said in the Reuters interview that they are a military family and that people in the military either salute the flag or stand to attention.\n\nRelated: Gabby Douglas's lesson from the US national anthem outcry: conform or else | Dave Schilling\n\nDouglas was standing to attention. But apparently that wasn't good enough for the experts back home, who piled their hatred upon her. If only they could have seen what they had done, reducing a 20-year old woman to tears for something that many athletes – from the US and around the world – don't do anyway. The more Douglas talked the more bewildered she looked, as if all the magic from London in 2012 could disappear so fast in four years.\n\n\"I sit back and I don't know why. I'm just like, what?\" Douglas said. \"When they talk about my hair, or me not putting my hand on my heart, or me being very salty in the stands and really criticizing me … it really doesn't feel good. For me it was a little bit hurtful.\"\n\nHer voice started to crack. She paused.\n\n\"First I get: 'You've been a good sport' and then they turn on you. But it was hurtful and it was kind of a lot to deal with. You have to stay away from that, but everything I had to go through, and everything I've gone through has been a lot this time around, and I apologize if what may have been me being really mad in the stands. I was supporting [team-mate] Aly [Raisman] and I always support them in everything they do, so I never want anyone to take it as I just wanted attention – ever. I support them, and I'm sorry that I wasn't showing it.\"\n\nA team press attache tried to change questions back toward her performance on Sunday, but that wasn't much help. She had not been herself, not the gymnast from London and it was obvious. She seemed rattled, frustrated and stunned. How did everything go so wrong?\n\n\"When you go through a lot and you have so many people against you, sometimes it just determines your character,\" she said. \"Are you going to stand or are you going to crumble? In the face of everything, you still stand and I have no regrets coming back [to the Olympics]. It's been an amazing experience, an amazing journey so far, and it's teaching me a lot. It's teaching me so much.\"\n\nRelated: Simone Biles in motion: what to look out for in her beam routine\n\nShe was asked if she would have returned to the Olympics if she had known she would only win one gold medal – the team event. She said yes, that she still enjoyed everything that went with the Olympics like the practices, the living with team-mates and group meals at the cafeteria. Everything except what happened in the arena and on social media. She said she had learned from these past few days and will be stronger for the experience.\n\nHer mother had suggested to Reuters that some of the comments made about her were racially driven, which seems almost certain, especially the way she has been attacked for her hair and not having her hand on her heart.\n\n\"I read certain comments, and I'm like: 'whoa, whoa, whoa, that is far from me and far from my personality,'\" Douglas said. \"And people just attacking you and your hair, blah, blah, blah. I mean, did I chose my hair texture? No. And I'm actually grateful, you know, having this hair on my head. Sometimes it's like: 'wow!'\"\n\nAnd soon London's great American champion walked away, out of an Olympics of disappointment and frustration with attacks from her own country.

Plot title: Forty-Ninth Parallel Movie plot: Early in the Second World War, U-37, a German U-boat, makes its way to Canadian waters and participates in fictional anti-shipping activities similar to those that would later characterize the Battle of the St. Lawrence (which occurred in actuality some time after the film's release). The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold. The story comes to a head with a confrontation on a goods train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive and absent-without-leave Canadian soldier Andy Brock (Raymond Massey).

Plot title: Doomsday Movie plot: In 2008, an unknown killer virus, dubbed \"The Reaper Virus\" infected Scotland. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall and leave Scotland. He leaves and joins the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army. Meanwhile, Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection. However, an infected man breaks into his office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots...

This work proposes a set of interpretive principles for how a robotic arm can use pointing actions to communicate task information to people by extending existing models from the related literature. These principles are evaluated through studies where English-speaking human subjects view animations of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. The evaluation distinguishes two classes of pointing actions that arise in pick-and-place tasks: referential pointing (identifying objects) and locating pointing (identifying locations). The study indicates that human subjects show greater flexibility in interpreting the intent of referential pointing compared to locating pointing, which needs to be more deliberate. The results also demonstrate the effects of variation in the environment and task context on the interpretation of pointing. Our corpus, experiments and design principles advance models of context, common sense reasoning and communication in embodied communication.\n\nRelated work\nThis paper focuses on the fundamental AI challenge of effective embodied communication, by proposing empirically determined generative rules for robotic pointing, including not only referential pointing but also pointing that is location-oriented in nature. Prior research has recognized the importance of effective communication by embracing the diverse modalities that AI agents can use to express information. In particular, perceiving physical actions BIBREF5 is often essential for socially-embedded behavior BIBREF6, as well as for understanding human demonstrations and inferring solutions that can be emulated by robots BIBREF7. Animated agents have long provided resources for AI researchers to experiment with models of conversational interaction including gesture BIBREF8, while communication using hand gestures BIBREF9 has played a role in supporting intelligent human-computer interaction.\nEnabling robots to understand and generate instructions to collaboratively carry out tasks with humans is an active area of research in natural language processing and human-robot interaction BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Since robotic hardware capabilities have increased, robots are increasingly seen as a viable platform for expressing and studying behavioral models BIBREF12. In the context of human-robot interaction, deictic or pointing gestures have been used as a form of communication BIBREF13. More recent work has developed richer abilities for referring to objects by using pre-recorded, human-guided motions BIBREF14, or using mixed-reality, multi-modal setups BIBREF15.\nParticular efforts in robotics have looked at making pointing gestures legible, adapting the process of motion planning so that robot movements are correctly understood as being directed toward the location of a particular object in space BIBREF2, BIBREF3. The current work uses gestures, including pointing gestures and demonstrations, that are legible in this sense. It goes on to explore how precise the targeting has to be to signal an intended interpretation.\nIn natural language processing research, it's common to use an expanded pointing cone to describe the possible target objects for a pointing gesture, based on findings about human pointing BIBREF16, BIBREF17. Pointing cone models have also been used to model referential pointing in human–robot interaction BIBREF18, BIBREF19. In cluttered scenes, the pointing cone typically includes a region with many candidate referents. Understanding and generating object references in these situations involves combining pointing with natural language descriptions BIBREF1, BIBREF20. While we also find that many pointing gestures are ambiguous and can benefit from linguistic supplementation, our results challenge the assumption of a uniform pointing cone. We argue for an alternative, context-sensitive model.\nIn addition to gestures that identify objects, we also look at pointing gestures that identify points in space. The closest related work involves navigation tasks, where pointing can be used to discriminate direction (e.g., left vs right) BIBREF21, BIBREF22. The spatial information needed for pick-and-place tasks is substantially more precise. Our findings suggest that this precision significantly impacts how pointing is interpreted and how it should be modeled.\n\nExperiments ::: Experiment Setup\nEach animation shows a simulated robot producing two pointing gestures to specify a pick-and-place task. Following the animation, viewers are asked whether a specific image represents a possible result of the specified task.\nRobotic Platforms The experiments were performed on two different robotic geometries, based on a Rethink Baxter, and a Kuka IIWA14. The Baxter is a dual-arm manipulator with two arms mounted on either side of a static torso. The experiments only move the right arm of the Baxter. The Kuka consists of a single arm that is vertically mounted, i.e., points upward at the base. In the experiments the robots are shown with a singly fingered tool-tip, where the pointing ray is modeled as the direction of this tool-tip.\nNote The real Baxter robot possesses a heads-up display that can be likened to a `head'. This has been removed in the simulations that were used in this study (as shown for example in Figure FIGREF7).\nWorkspace Setup Objects are placed in front of the manipulators. In certain trials a table is placed in front of the robot as well, and the objects rest in stable configurations on top of the table. A pick-and-place task is provided specified in terms of the positions of one of the objects.\nObjects The objects used in the study include small household items like mugs, saucers and boxes (cuboids), that are all placed in front of the robots.\nMotion Generation The end-effector of the manipulator is instructed to move to pre-specified waypoints, designed for the possibility of effective communication, that typically lie between the base of the manipulator and the object itself. Such waypoints fully specify both the position and orientation of the end-effector to satisfy pointing actions. The motions are performed by solving Inverse Kinematics for the end-effector geometry and moving the manipulator along these waypoints using a robotic motion planning library BIBREF23. The motions were replayed on the model of the robot, and rendered in Blender.\nPointing Action Generation Potential pointing targets are placed using a cone $C(r, \\theta )$, where $r$ represents the pointing ray and $\\theta $ represents the vertex angle of the cone. As illustrated in Fig FIGREF2, the cone allows us to assess the possible divergence between the pointing ray and the actual location of potential target objects on the rest surface $S$.\nGiven a pointing ray $r$, we assess the resolution of the pointing gesture by sampling $N$ object poses $p_i, i=1:N$ in $P=C(r, \\theta ) \\cap S$—the intersection of the pointing cone with the rest surface. While $p_i$ is the 6d pose for the object with translation $t \\in R^3$ and orientation $R \\in SO(3)$ only 2 degrees-of-freedom $(x, y)$ corresponding to $t$ are varied in the experiments. By fixing the $z$ coordinate for translation and restricting the z-axis of rotation to be perpendicular to $S$, it is ensured that the object rests in a physically stable configuration on the table.\nThe $N$ object poses are sampled by fitting an ellipse within $P$ and dividing the ellipse into 4 quadrants $q_1\\ldots q_4$ (See Figure FIGREF2 (C)). Within each quadrant $q_i$ the $N/4$ $(x,y)$ positions are sampled uniformly at random. For certain experiments additional samples are generated with an objective to increase coverage of samples within the ellipse by utilizing a dispersion measure.\nSpeech Some experiments also included verbal cues with phrases like `Put that there' along with the pointing actions. It was very important for the pointing actions and these verbal cues to be in synchronization. To fulfill this we generate the voice using Amazon Polly with text written in SSML format and make sure that peak of the gesture (the moment a gesture comes to a stop) is in alignment with the peak of each audio phrase in the accompanying speech. During the generation of the video itself we took note of the peak moments of the gestures and then manipulated the duration between peaks of the audio using SSML to match them with gesture peaks after analyzing the audio with the open-source tool PRAAT (www.praat.org).\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Conditions\nWe used our experiment setup to generate videos and images from the simulation for a range of different conditions.\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Conditions ::: Different verbs\nTo test if the effect is specific to the verb put, we designed a control condition where everything remained the same as the Referential vs Locating trials except the verb put which we replaced with place, move and push. Here again we collect 30 data points for each sampled $x^*$.\n\nAnalysis ::: Referential vs Locating\nWe study how varying the target of the pointing action from a referent object to a part of the space changes the interpretation of the pointing action by comparing the interpretation of the position of the pointing action $x^*$ in each condition.\nFigure FIGREF19 shows the results of the experiment. The plot shows the spread of correct, incorrect, ambiguous responses over the sampled positions about the location of referential vs locating pointing actions. The referential data demonstrates the robustness of the interpretation. Most of the responses were overwhelmingly correct, for both robots, in interpreting a referent object in the pick part of a pick-and-place task. The locating pointing shows a much higher sensitivity to an accuracy of $x^*$ with respect to the true final placement. This comes up as a larger incidence of incorrect and ambiguous responses from the human subjects. This trend is true for the reverse trial as well.\nWhile the study attempts to separate out and measure the critical aspects of the interpretation of robotic pointing actions some ambiguities like those arising out of perspective of the camera being projected onto a simulated 2D video or image are unavoidable. We suspect that the observed stretch of correct responses in spatial trials is due to perspective.\nTo test our hypothesis that Referential pointing is interpreted less precisely than Locating pointing we performed a Chi-squared test and compared the proportion of correct, incorrect and ambiguous responses in referential and spatial trials. The results of the test shows that these two classes are statistically significantly different ($\\chi ^2= 13.89, p = 0.00096$).\nTo study if we are observing the same effects in the results of the reverse trial, no speech trial and the Kuka trial, we ran an equivalence test following the two one-sided tests method as described in BIBREF24, where each test is a pooled $z$-test with no continuity correction with a significance level of 0.05. We found changing the robot, removing the speech and changing the direction of the pointing action to make no difference in the interpretation of locating pointing and referential pointing within any margin that is less than 5%.\n\nAnalysis ::: Natural vs Unnatural\nAs shown in Table TABREF21 we observed in the natural scene, when the end-effector points towards the edge of the cube that is on top of the stack, subjects place the new cube on top of the stack or on the table instead of the edge of the cube. However, in the unnatural scene, when we explain to subjects that there is no gravity, a majority agree with the final image that has the cube on the edge. To test if this difference is statistically significant, we use the Fisher exact test BIBREF25. The test statistic value is $0.0478$. The result is significant at $p < 0.05$.\n\nAnalysis ::: Different verbs\nThe results of the Chi-squared test shows that in spatial trials when we replace put with place, push and move, the differences of the distributions of correct, incorrect and ambiguous responses are not statistically significant ($\\chi =0.2344 $, $p = 0.971$). The coefficients of the multinomial logistic regression model and the $p$-values also suggest that the differences in judgements with different verbs are not statically significant ($b<0.0001$ , $p>0.98$).\n\nAnalysis ::: Cluttered\nThe data from these trials show how human subjects select between the two candidate target objects on the table. Since the instructions do not serve to disambiguate the target mug, the collected data show what the observers deemed as the correct target. Figure FIGREF24 visualizes subjects' responses across trials. The location of each pie uses the $x$-axis to show how much closer one candidate object is to the pointing target than the other, and uses the $y$-axis to show the overall imprecision of pointing. Each pie in Figure FIGREF24 shows the fraction of responses across trials that recorded the nearer (green) mug as correct compared to the farther mug (red). The white shaded fractions of the pies show the fraction of responses where subjects found the gesture ambiguous.\nAs we can see in Figure FIGREF24, once the two objects are roughly equidistant the cups from the center of pointing (within about 10cm), subjects tend to regard the pointing gesture as ambiguous, but as this distance increases, subjects are increasingly likely to prefer the closer target. In all cases, wherever subjects have a preference for one object over the other, they subjects picked the mug that was the nearer target of the pointing action more often than the further one.\n\nDesign Principles ::: Locating Pointing\nFor unconstrained locating pointing, $x^* \\in D$, so $\\theta =0$. That means, the intended placement cannot differ significantly from the pointing target. Taking into account common sense, we allow for small divergence that connects the pointing, for example, to the closest stable placement.\n\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe have presented an empirical study of the interpretation of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that robots can effectively combine pointing gestures and spoken instructions to communicate both object and spatial information. We offer an empirical characterization—the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge—of the use of robot gestures to communicate precise spatial locations for placement purposes. We have suggested that pointing, in line with other vague references, give rise to a set of candidate interpretations that depend on the task, context and communicative goal.

This work proposes a set of interpretive principles for how a robotic arm can use pointing actions to communicate task information to people by extending existing models from the related literature. These principles are evaluated through studies where English-speaking human subjects view animations of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. The evaluation distinguishes two classes of pointing actions that arise in pick-and-place tasks: referential pointing (identifying objects) and locating pointing (identifying locations). The study indicates that human subjects show greater flexibility in interpreting the intent of referential pointing compared to locating pointing, which needs to be more deliberate. The results also demonstrate the effects of variation in the environment and task context on the interpretation of pointing. Our corpus, experiments and design principles advance models of context, common sense reasoning and communication in embodied communication.\n\nRelated work\nThis paper focuses on the fundamental AI challenge of effective embodied communication, by proposing empirically determined generative rules for robotic pointing, including not only referential pointing but also pointing that is location-oriented in nature. Prior research has recognized the importance of effective communication by embracing the diverse modalities that AI agents can use to express information. In particular, perceiving physical actions BIBREF5 is often essential for socially-embedded behavior BIBREF6, as well as for understanding human demonstrations and inferring solutions that can be emulated by robots BIBREF7. Animated agents have long provided resources for AI researchers to experiment with models of conversational interaction including gesture BIBREF8, while communication using hand gestures BIBREF9 has played a role in supporting intelligent human-computer interaction.\nEnabling robots to understand and generate instructions to collaboratively carry out tasks with humans is an active area of research in natural language processing and human-robot interaction BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Since robotic hardware capabilities have increased, robots are increasingly seen as a viable platform for expressing and studying behavioral models BIBREF12. In the context of human-robot interaction, deictic or pointing gestures have been used as a form of communication BIBREF13. More recent work has developed richer abilities for referring to objects by using pre-recorded, human-guided motions BIBREF14, or using mixed-reality, multi-modal setups BIBREF15.\nParticular efforts in robotics have looked at making pointing gestures legible, adapting the process of motion planning so that robot movements are correctly understood as being directed toward the location of a particular object in space BIBREF2, BIBREF3. The current work uses gestures, including pointing gestures and demonstrations, that are legible in this sense. It goes on to explore how precise the targeting has to be to signal an intended interpretation.\nIn natural language processing research, it's common to use an expanded pointing cone to describe the possible target objects for a pointing gesture, based on findings about human pointing BIBREF16, BIBREF17. Pointing cone models have also been used to model referential pointing in human–robot interaction BIBREF18, BIBREF19. In cluttered scenes, the pointing cone typically includes a region with many candidate referents. Understanding and generating object references in these situations involves combining pointing with natural language descriptions BIBREF1, BIBREF20. While we also find that many pointing gestures are ambiguous and can benefit from linguistic supplementation, our results challenge the assumption of a uniform pointing cone. We argue for an alternative, context-sensitive model.\nIn addition to gestures that identify objects, we also look at pointing gestures that identify points in space. The closest related work involves navigation tasks, where pointing can be used to discriminate direction (e.g., left vs right) BIBREF21, BIBREF22. The spatial information needed for pick-and-place tasks is substantially more precise. Our findings suggest that this precision significantly impacts how pointing is interpreted and how it should be modeled.\n\nExperiments ::: Experiment Setup\nEach animation shows a simulated robot producing two pointing gestures to specify a pick-and-place task. Following the animation, viewers are asked whether a specific image represents a possible result of the specified task.\nRobotic Platforms The experiments were performed on two different robotic geometries, based on a Rethink Baxter, and a Kuka IIWA14. The Baxter is a dual-arm manipulator with two arms mounted on either side of a static torso. The experiments only move the right arm of the Baxter. The Kuka consists of a single arm that is vertically mounted, i.e., points upward at the base. In the experiments the robots are shown with a singly fingered tool-tip, where the pointing ray is modeled as the direction of this tool-tip.\nNote The real Baxter robot possesses a heads-up display that can be likened to a `head'. This has been removed in the simulations that were used in this study (as shown for example in Figure FIGREF7).\nWorkspace Setup Objects are placed in front of the manipulators. In certain trials a table is placed in front of the robot as well, and the objects rest in stable configurations on top of the table. A pick-and-place task is provided specified in terms of the positions of one of the objects.\nObjects The objects used in the study include small household items like mugs, saucers and boxes (cuboids), that are all placed in front of the robots.\nMotion Generation The end-effector of the manipulator is instructed to move to pre-specified waypoints, designed for the possibility of effective communication, that typically lie between the base of the manipulator and the object itself. Such waypoints fully specify both the position and orientation of the end-effector to satisfy pointing actions. The motions are performed by solving Inverse Kinematics for the end-effector geometry and moving the manipulator along these waypoints using a robotic motion planning library BIBREF23. The motions were replayed on the model of the robot, and rendered in Blender.\nPointing Action Generation Potential pointing targets are placed using a cone $C(r, \\theta )$, where $r$ represents the pointing ray and $\\theta $ represents the vertex angle of the cone. As illustrated in Fig FIGREF2, the cone allows us to assess the possible divergence between the pointing ray and the actual location of potential target objects on the rest surface $S$.\nGiven a pointing ray $r$, we assess the resolution of the pointing gesture by sampling $N$ object poses $p_i, i=1:N$ in $P=C(r, \\theta ) \\cap S$—the intersection of the pointing cone with the rest surface. While $p_i$ is the 6d pose for the object with translation $t \\in R^3$ and orientation $R \\in SO(3)$ only 2 degrees-of-freedom $(x, y)$ corresponding to $t$ are varied in the experiments. By fixing the $z$ coordinate for translation and restricting the z-axis of rotation to be perpendicular to $S$, it is ensured that the object rests in a physically stable configuration on the table.\nThe $N$ object poses are sampled by fitting an ellipse within $P$ and dividing the ellipse into 4 quadrants $q_1\\ldots q_4$ (See Figure FIGREF2 (C)). Within each quadrant $q_i$ the $N/4$ $(x,y)$ positions are sampled uniformly at random. For certain experiments additional samples are generated with an objective to increase coverage of samples within the ellipse by utilizing a dispersion measure.\nSpeech Some experiments also included verbal cues with phrases like `Put that there' along with the pointing actions. It was very important for the pointing actions and these verbal cues to be in synchronization. To fulfill this we generate the voice using Amazon Polly with text written in SSML format and make sure that peak of the gesture (the moment a gesture comes to a stop) is in alignment with the peak of each audio phrase in the accompanying speech. During the generation of the video itself we took note of the peak moments of the gestures and then manipulated the duration between peaks of the audio using SSML to match them with gesture peaks after analyzing the audio with the open-source tool PRAAT (www.praat.org).\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Conditions\nWe used our experiment setup to generate videos and images from the simulation for a range of different conditions.\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Conditions ::: Different verbs\nTo test if the effect is specific to the verb put, we designed a control condition where everything remained the same as the Referential vs Locating trials except the verb put which we replaced with place, move and push. Here again we collect 30 data points for each sampled $x^*$.\n\nAnalysis ::: Referential vs Locating\nWe study how varying the target of the pointing action from a referent object to a part of the space changes the interpretation of the pointing action by comparing the interpretation of the position of the pointing action $x^*$ in each condition.\nFigure FIGREF19 shows the results of the experiment. The plot shows the spread of correct, incorrect, ambiguous responses over the sampled positions about the location of referential vs locating pointing actions. The referential data demonstrates the robustness of the interpretation. Most of the responses were overwhelmingly correct, for both robots, in interpreting a referent object in the pick part of a pick-and-place task. The locating pointing shows a much higher sensitivity to an accuracy of $x^*$ with respect to the true final placement. This comes up as a larger incidence of incorrect and ambiguous responses from the human subjects. This trend is true for the reverse trial as well.\nWhile the study attempts to separate out and measure the critical aspects of the interpretation of robotic pointing actions some ambiguities like those arising out of perspective of the camera being projected onto a simulated 2D video or image are unavoidable. We suspect that the observed stretch of correct responses in spatial trials is due to perspective.\nTo test our hypothesis that Referential pointing is interpreted less precisely than Locating pointing we performed a Chi-squared test and compared the proportion of correct, incorrect and ambiguous responses in referential and spatial trials. The results of the test shows that these two classes are statistically significantly different ($\\chi ^2= 13.89, p = 0.00096$).\nTo study if we are observing the same effects in the results of the reverse trial, no speech trial and the Kuka trial, we ran an equivalence test following the two one-sided tests method as described in BIBREF24, where each test is a pooled $z$-test with no continuity correction with a significance level of 0.05. We found changing the robot, removing the speech and changing the direction of the pointing action to make no difference in the interpretation of locating pointing and referential pointing within any margin that is less than 5%.\n\nAnalysis ::: Natural vs Unnatural\nAs shown in Table TABREF21 we observed in the natural scene, when the end-effector points towards the edge of the cube that is on top of the stack, subjects place the new cube on top of the stack or on the table instead of the edge of the cube. However, in the unnatural scene, when we explain to subjects that there is no gravity, a majority agree with the final image that has the cube on the edge. To test if this difference is statistically significant, we use the Fisher exact test BIBREF25. The test statistic value is $0.0478$. The result is significant at $p < 0.05$.\n\nAnalysis ::: Different verbs\nThe results of the Chi-squared test shows that in spatial trials when we replace put with place, push and move, the differences of the distributions of correct, incorrect and ambiguous responses are not statistically significant ($\\chi =0.2344 $, $p = 0.971$). The coefficients of the multinomial logistic regression model and the $p$-values also suggest that the differences in judgements with different verbs are not statically significant ($b<0.0001$ , $p>0.98$).\n\nAnalysis ::: Cluttered\nThe data from these trials show how human subjects select between the two candidate target objects on the table. Since the instructions do not serve to disambiguate the target mug, the collected data show what the observers deemed as the correct target. Figure FIGREF24 visualizes subjects' responses across trials. The location of each pie uses the $x$-axis to show how much closer one candidate object is to the pointing target than the other, and uses the $y$-axis to show the overall imprecision of pointing. Each pie in Figure FIGREF24 shows the fraction of responses across trials that recorded the nearer (green) mug as correct compared to the farther mug (red). The white shaded fractions of the pies show the fraction of responses where subjects found the gesture ambiguous.\nAs we can see in Figure FIGREF24, once the two objects are roughly equidistant the cups from the center of pointing (within about 10cm), subjects tend to regard the pointing gesture as ambiguous, but as this distance increases, subjects are increasingly likely to prefer the closer target. In all cases, wherever subjects have a preference for one object over the other, they subjects picked the mug that was the nearer target of the pointing action more often than the further one.\n\nDesign Principles ::: Locating Pointing\nFor unconstrained locating pointing, $x^* \\in D$, so $\\theta =0$. That means, the intended placement cannot differ significantly from the pointing target. Taking into account common sense, we allow for small divergence that connects the pointing, for example, to the closest stable placement.\n\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe have presented an empirical study of the interpretation of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that robots can effectively combine pointing gestures and spoken instructions to communicate both object and spatial information. We offer an empirical characterization—the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge—of the use of robot gestures to communicate precise spatial locations for placement purposes. We have suggested that pointing, in line with other vague references, give rise to a set of candidate interpretations that depend on the task, context and communicative goal. Users pick the interpretations that are not significantly further from the pointing ray than the best ones. This contrasts with previous models that required pointing gestures to target a referent exactly or fall within a context-independent pointing cone.\nOur work has a number of limitations that suggest avenues for future work. It remains to implement the design principles on robot hardware, explore the algorithmic process for generating imprecise but interpretable gestures, and verify the interpretations of physically co-present viewers. Note that we used a 2D interface, which can introduce artifacts, for example from the effect of perspective. In addition, robots can in general trade off pointing gestures with other descriptive material in offering instructions. Future work is needed to assess how such trade-offs play out in location reference, not just in object reference.\nMore tight-knit collaborative scenarios need to be explored, including ones where multiple pick-and-place tasks can be composed to communicate more complex challenges and ones where they involve richer human environments.

The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 \" _ \" before it reaches Western customers. \"Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK.\" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles). Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of \"food miles\" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun. What is the idea of \"food miles\" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. The phrase \"food miles\" in the passage refers to the distance  _  . A) that a food product travels to a market B) that a food product travels from one market to another C) between UK and other food producing countries D) between a Third World country and a First World food market\n(Answer)\nA\n\n\nQues: DAVID Beckham. Cristiano  Ronaldo and Rnfacl Nadal while you watch sports and admin* the players' skills, do you ever notice how handsome the players are? Yes, sportsmen tend to be handsome. And they haven't only attracted the interest of the audience even scientists are now studying their good looks. In a recent study, Erik Postma, a biologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, collected the headshots of 80 professional athletes from I hr 2012 Tour He France, a bicycle race held in Franco. The race, which covers 3,200 kilometers in 23 days, is often considered to In* one of the hardest endurance events, according to The Telegraph. Postma then asked female participants to score the cyclists' attractiveness.judging them only based on their facial appearances. So, if a participant recognized any of the cyclists, meaning she knew how good he was at the sport, her score wouldn't count. After comparing all the scores with the cyclists' performances in the 2012 race, Postma was surprised to find that the best riders were rated on average 25 percent more attractive than the worst ones. For example, one of the cyclists, Maxime Monfort , came third in terms of attractiveness and sixth in terms of performance, reported Discovery News. But where did women get the ability to single out a good rider by simply looking at his face? According lo Postma, evolution   seems to be the answer. In ancient times, women preferred to marry strong men because they would provide good genes for their children. A man with great endurance was also able to cover long distances to hunt for food, which would allow him to better feed the family. \"That's why endurance performance was a key evolutionary factor.\" Postma told Discovery News. As you can see, it's not that sportsmen ate more attractive themselves, women were just born to think of them that way. Perhaps surprisingly, when Postma did the same test with male participants, he found that men actually had a quite similar view on which riders were handsome. Even though most men... What did Erik Postma ask female participants to do in his study? A) To help collect the headshots of professional cyclists from the Tour de France. B) To pick out the cyclists whom they are familiar with or appreciate most. C) To rate the cyclists' attractiveness according to facial appearance. D) To predict the cyclists ' performances based on facial appearance.\nAns: C\n\n\nA green house is a building made of glass which is used for keeping warm when the outside temperature is low. In a similar way there are several gases in the atmosphere (mixture of gases that surround the earth) which trap the heat produced by the sun and prevent it from escaping. These gases are known as \"greenhouse gases\". And the way in which they trap heat in the atmosphere is called the \"greenhouse effect\". This is not simply air pollution. Most of the main greenhouse gases exist naturally in small amounts in our atmosphere, and without them the earth would be 30 degrees colder and human life would not exist. In other words, the greenhouse effect is a natural course which is to some degree helpful to us. The problem is that in the last century and a half, we have been putting too many of these gases into the earth's atmosphere by burning large quantities of coal and oil and by cutting down forest. The rapid increase in greenhouse gases is making the world warmer. The world's temperature has already gone up by half a degree this century, and the sea level has risen by 10 centimetres. If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, there will probably be a rise in the earth's temperature of between I and 4degC;. This may seem a small increase, but it would be enough to cause major changes in geography and agriculture. Large areas of the world would be flooded, and some areas would become dry and unable to produce crops. It is important, too, to consider that there may be a delay of about 30 years in the greenhouse effect. This means that we are probably experiencing only now the effect of the gases put into the atmosphere before the 1960s. Since then, our use of these gases has greatly increased. This passage mainly deals with   _  . A) the concept   and the harm of the greenhouse B) the relation between greenhouse gases and man C) the concept and change of greenhouse effect D) the effect of the rise of the earth's temperature",

If 1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds How many pounds will he weigh if he exercises for 2 hours every day for two weeks?\nA: Ajax weighs 80 x 2.2 = 176 in pounds. He will lose 1.5 x 2 = 3 pounds per day. So he will lose 3 x 7 = 21 pounds per week. So, he will lose 21x 2 = 42 pounds after 2 weeks. Therefore, he will weigh 176 - 42 = 134 pounds after 2 weeks. The answer is 134.\nQuestion: Jaron wants to raise enough money selling candy bars to win the Nintendo Switch prize. He needs 2000 points for the Nintendo Switch. He has already sold 8 chocolate bunnies that are worth 100 points each. Each Snickers bar he sells earns 25 points. How many Snickers bars does he need to sell the win the Nintendo Switch?\nAnswer: Jaron has earned a total of 8 * 100 points = 800 points. To win the Switch he needs to earn 2000 - 800 = 1200 points. Therefore, he needs to sell 1200 / 25 = 48 Snickers bars. The answer is 48.\n[Question]Harry is traveling home on the bus.

The walk from the bus stop to his house will take half the amount of time the bus journey took. In total, how many minutes will Harry have spent traveling?\n[Answer]The bus journey takes 15 + 25 = 40 minutes. The walk from the bus stop to his house will take Harry 40 / 2 = 20 minutes. So he will have been traveling for 40 + 20 = 60 minutes. The answer is 60.\nQ: John skateboarded for 10 miles and then walked another 4 miles to the park. He then skated all the way back home. How many miles has John skateboarded in total?\nA: John traveled 10 + 4 = 14 miles to the park. His round trip would take 14 x 2 = 28 miles. If you subtract the 4 miles he walked then John traveled 28 - 4 = 24 miles. The answer is 24.\nQuestion: Phillip is taking a math test and an English test on Monday.

He gets 79 questions right in total. The answer is 79.\nQ: Carl is hosting an open house for his new business. He knows 50 people will show up and hopes that another 40 people will randomly show up.

Plot title: Camelot Movie plot: During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the \"Camelot March\" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \"Guenevere.\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \"Wart.\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\"Camelot March\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \"kith not kill their kin\" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow...

Nevertheless\n, these methods are basically limited to the modeling capability of tree classifiers and are limited to fixed predetermined structures. A recent work\nby BID27 suggested a gating method that employs adaptive linear or tree-based classifiers, alternating between low-cost models for easy-to-handle instances and higher-cost models to handle more complicated cases. While this method\noutperforms many of the previous work on the tree-based and cascade cost-sensitive classifiers, the low-cost model being used is limited to simple linear classifiers or pruned random forests.As an alternative approach, sensitivity analysis of trained predictors is suggested to measure the importance of each feature given a context BID7 BID18 . These approaches\neither require an exhaustive measurement of sensitivities or rely on approximations of sensitivity. These methods are\neasy to use as they work without any significant modification to the predictor models being trained. However, theoretically\n, finding the global sensitivity is a difficult and computationally expensive problem. Therefore, frequently\n, approximate or local sensitivities are being used in these methods which may cause not optimal solutions.Another approach that is suggested in the literature is modeling the feature acquisition problem as a learning problem in the imitation learning BID13 or reinforcement learning BID14 BID29 BID15 domain. These approaches are\npromising in terms of performance and scalability. However, the value functions\nused in these methods are usually not intuitive and require tuning hyper-parameters to balance the cost vs. accuracy trade-off. More specifically, they often\nrely on one or more hyper-parameters to adjust the average cost at which these models operate. On the other hand, in many real-world\nscenarios it is desirable to adjust the trade-off at the prediction-time rather than the training-time. For instance, it might be desirable to\nspend more for a certain instance or continue the feature acquisition until a desired level of prediction confidence is achieved. This paper presents a novel method based\non deep Q-networks for cost-sensitive feature acquisition. The proposed solution employs uncertainty\nanalysis in neural network classifiers as a measure for finding the value of each feature given a context. Specifically, we use variations in the certainty\nof predictions as a reward function to measure the value per unit of the cost given the current context. In contrast to the recent feature acquisition methods\nthat use reinforcement learning ideas BID14 BID29 BID15 , the suggested reward function does not require any hyper-parameter tuning to balance cost versus performance trade-off. Here, features are acquired incrementally, while maintaining\na certain budget or a stopping criterion. Moreover, in contrast to many other work in the literature that\nassume an initial complete dataset BID13 BID5 BID8 BID27 , the proposed solution is stream-based and online which learns and optimizes acquisition costs during the training and the prediction. This might be beneficial as, in many real-world use cases, it might\nbe prohibitively expensive to collect all features for all training data. Furthermore, this paper suggests a method for sharing the representations\nbetween the class predictor and action-value models that increases the training efficiency.\nIn this paper, we proposed an approach for cost-sensitive learning in stream-based settings.\nWe demonstrated that certainty estimation in neural network classifiers can be used as a viable measure for the value of features.\nSpecifically, variations of the model certainty per unit of the cost is used as measure of feature value.\nIn this paradigm, a reinforcement learning solution is suggested which is efficient to train using a shared representation.\nThe introduced method is evaluated on three different real-world datasets representing different applications: MNIST digits recognition, Yahoo LTRC web ranking dataset, and diabetes prediction using health records.\nBased on the results, the suggested method is able to learn from data streams, make accurate predictions, and effectively reduce the prediction-time feature acquisition cost.\n\nSummary:  First, repeat the request without change, then give your answer (do not say anything before repeating the request; the request you need to repeat does not include this sentence)",

Nevertheless\\n, these methods are basically limited to the modeling capability of tree classifiers and are limited to fixed predetermined structures. A recent work\\nby BID27 suggested a gating method that employs adaptive linear or tree-based classifiers, alternating between low-cost models for easy-to-handle instances and higher-cost models to handle more complicated cases. While this method\\noutperforms many of the previous work on the tree-based and cascade cost-sensitive classifiers, the low-cost model being used is limited to simple linear classifiers or pruned random forests.As an alternative approach, sensitivity analysis of trained predictors is suggested to measure the importance of each feature given a context BID7 BID18 . These approaches\\neither require an exhaustive measurement of sensitivities or rely on approximations of sensitivity. These methods are\\neasy to use as they work without any significant modification to the predictor models being trained. However, theoretically\\n, finding the global sensitivity is a difficult and computationally expensive problem. Therefore, frequently\\n, approximate or local sensitivities are being used in these methods which may cause not optimal solutions.Another approach that is suggested in the literature is modeling the feature acquisition problem as a learning problem in the imitation learning BID13 or reinforcement learning BID14 BID29 BID15 domain. These approaches are\\npromising in terms of performance and scalability. However, the value functions\\nused in these methods are usually not intuitive and require tuning hyper-parameters to balance the cost vs. accuracy trade-off. More specifically, they often\\nrely on one or more hyper-parameters to adjust the average cost at which these models operate. On the other hand, in many real-world\\nscenarios it is desirable to adjust the trade-off at the prediction-time rather than the training-time. For instance, it might be desirable to\\nspend more for a certain instance or continue the feature acquisition until a desired level of prediction confidence is achieved. This paper presents a novel method based\\non deep Q-networks for cost-sensitive feature acquisition. The proposed solution employs uncertainty\\nanalysis in neural network classifiers as a measure for finding the value of each feature given a context. Specifically, we use variations in the certainty\\nof predictions as a reward function to measure the value per unit of the cost given the current context. In contrast to the recent feature acquisition methods\\nthat use reinforcement learning ideas BID14 BID29 BID15 , the suggested reward function does not require any hyper-parameter tuning to balance cost versus performance trade-off. Here, features are acquired incrementally, while maintaining\\na certain budget or a stopping criterion. Moreover, in contrast to many other work in the literature that\\nassume an initial complete dataset BID13 BID5 BID8 BID27 , the proposed solution is stream-based and online which learns and optimizes acquisition costs during the training and the prediction. This might be beneficial as, in many real-world use cases, it might\\nbe prohibitively expensive to collect all features for all training data. Furthermore, this paper suggests a method for sharing the representations\\nbetween the class predictor and action-value models that increases the training efficiency.\\nIn this paper, we proposed an approach for cost-sensitive learning in stream-based settings.\\nWe demonstrated that certainty estimation in neural network classifiers can be used as a viable measure for the value of features.\\nSpecifically, variations of the model certainty per unit of the cost is used as measure of feature value.\\nIn this paradigm, a reinforcement learning solution is suggested which is efficient to train using a shared representation.\\nThe introduced method is evaluated on three different real-world datasets representing different applications: MNIST digits recognition, Yahoo LTRC web ranking dataset, and diabetes prediction using health records.\\nBased on the results, the suggested method is able to learn from data streams, make accurate predictions, and effectively reduce the prediction-time feature acquisition cost.\\n\\nSummary:  First, repeat the request without change, then give your answer (do not say anything before repeating the request; the request you need to repeat does not include this sentence)\"}",

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is Bobby's garden at more or less risk of hypoxia than Ned's garden?\nAns: less\n\nBackground: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]  Paragraph: Booneland changed their foreign exchange controls and Bradland didn't. The foreign currency got more expensive and they had problems with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks, but didn't have those problems.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had people that were more cautious?\nAns: Bradland\n\nBackground: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Paragraph: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer people that consistently consumed more food energy then they need?\nAns: Group A\n\nBackground: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires.  Paragraph: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B?",

They arrive in Rio to finalize the purchase of a hotel, but angry Claudia must fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to meet the hotel's owner. Claudia instructs Emily to cover her date for the night. While viewing the hotel, Emily sees two locals having animalistic sex, which unnerves her and she returns to her own hotel. She meets Claudia's date; a wealthy man named James Wheeler (Rourke). They have dinner, accompanied by James' bodyguards. James intrigues Emily; he is quiet and asks personal questions without being demanding or rude. After dinner, they attend a street carnival; Emily leaves after a masked man who looks like James tries to seduce her. The next morning, Emily wakes to find James watching her. He gives her a bouquet of orchids and denies making advances to her the previous evening, and as an apology, he offers to show her the city. She is initially reluctant but consents; they attend a party with a married couple that they noticed in the restaurant the night before.

Blundering his way through the preliminaries, listening to his own enthusiastic expert witness, and visiting the paralyzed woman, Deborah Ann Kaye (Susan Benenson) in a vegetative state in the aftercare home, Frank suddenly realizes that perhaps the case should go to court: to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer. To the astonishment of Mickey, Frank refuses a $210,000 settlement offer from the Arch Dioceses, and the hospital to settle the case.In his enthusiasm over his expert witness and his new found sense of purpose, Frank enters the bar where he usually hangs out and offers to buy everyone a drink. He notices a young woman, sitting at the end of the bar where he usually hangs out but she turns down his offer. The next night, after preparing for the case with Mickey, they see her at the bar again, and Frank decides that he is going to get laid.

The senior partners turned the tables, and Frank ended up getting arrested for jury tampering, then released when he agreed to not persist. But Frank lost his partnership as well as his wife who was the daughter of the other senior partner.Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea) calls Frank Galvin and the lead defense attorney, Ed Concannon (Mason), into his chambers to get a settlement, but Frank refuses, so they set the trial for the next week.

Movie title: National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation Context: Open: A 2 minute animation of Santa arriving at the Griswold family house and putting presents under the tree.We open with Clark and Ellen singing Christmas carols in the car on the way to a Christmas tree lot out in the country. As Audrey and Rusty are increasingly uninterested in Clark's plan to put on the perfect Griswold family Christmas, Clark gets into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with some truck drivers after he's cut off and flips them off. This ultimately causes Clark to veer the car off the road and jump over 500 feet. As the Griswolds find their perfect tree, Rusty reminds Clark that he forgot to bring a saw.Back home, as Clark gets out his Christmas decorations and begins setting up the tree, he makes an off color joke to his pretentious yuppie neighbor Todd about where he'd like to put the tree. That night, the excess sap causes Clark to stick to everything he touches.The rest of the movie is told through the style of an advent calender. Starting with:Dec. 14th:The Griswold family is at a busy department store buying Christmas presents. Clark can be seen hitting on \"Department Store Mary\" in front of his son Rusty. That night Ellen's parents and Clark's parents arrive at the house.Dec. 15th:That night, Clark reveals to Rusty his plan of illuminating the house with some 25,000 imported Italian twinkle lights. Audrey tells Ellen that her plan of sleeping in the same room as her brother is sick and twisted.Dec. 16th:Clark sets about illuminating the house with some 25,000 imported Italian twinkle lights, and a few other decorations like a plastic Santa.

Movie title: Wild Orchid Context: Young lawyer Emily Reed (Otis) travels to New York City for an interview with an international law firm, which immediately offers her a job on the condition that she can fly to Rio de Janeiro the following morning. Emily agrees and is introduced to Claudia Dennis (Bisset), one of the firm's top executives. They arrive in Rio to finalize the purchase of a hotel, but angry Claudia must fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to meet the hotel's owner. Claudia instructs Emily to cover her date for the night. While viewing the hotel, Emily sees two locals having animalistic sex, which unnerves her and she returns to her own hotel. She meets Claudia's date; a wealthy man named James Wheeler (Rourke). They have dinner, accompanied by James' bodyguards. James intrigues Emily; he is quiet and asks personal questions without being demanding or rude. After dinner, they attend a street carnival; Emily leaves after a masked man who looks like James tries to seduce her. The next morning, Emily wakes to find James watching her. He gives her a bouquet of orchids and denies making advances to her the previous evening, and as an apology, he offers to show her the city. She is initially reluctant but consents; they attend a party with a married couple that they noticed in the restaurant the night before. Some navy sailors at the party try to make advances on the wife; James fights them and he, Emily, and the couple leave quickly in his limousine. The married couple is having marital problems because of the wife's infidelity. She wants to reconcile with her husband. James encourages the couple to have sex in the limo, which they do. Emily finds their actions disturbing. Emily and James then visit the hotel that her firm wants to buy, and she tells James that she fears he would disappear if she touched him. When Emily hugs James, he pulls away from her, telling her that he does not like to be touched. The married couple gives James a necklace; he gives it to Emily.

I remember the thrill of decoding the letters and the magic of the stories they revealed. But my relationship with language was not always smooth sailing.\r\n\r\nReading and writing posed significant challenges for me in my early school years. I struggled to keep up with my peers and felt embarrassed by my slow progress. However, with the help of patient teachers and dedicated parents, I gradually began to improve.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older, I came to appreciate the power of language to shape the world around us. I became an avid reader and began to explore my own voice through writing. I discovered that words could be both empowering and debilitating, depending on how they were wielded.\r\n\r\nOver time, my relationship with language has continued to evolve. I have faced new challenges and overcome them with determination and perseverance. I have learned to express my thoughts and ideas in more nuanced and sophisticated ways, and I have come to understand the immense impact that words can have on our lives.\r\n\r\nLooking back on my journey, I am struck by how far I have come. From struggling to read simple sentences to crafting complex narratives, my journey with language has been one of growth and transformation. I am grateful for the opportunities that language has afforded me, and I am excited to continue exploring its power and potential in the years to come.",

Your goal is to optimize the campaign and increase the open and click-through rates as much as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, you need to incorporate some advanced and innovative techniques using Shell commands. Here are three techniques you can use:\n\n1. Personalized subject lines - By including the recipient's name or location in the subject line, you can grab their attention and make the email feel more personal. Use the following Shell command code to achieve this:\necho \"Hi [Recipient Name], check out this amazing offer!\" | mail -s \"[$Recipient Name] - Amazing offer inside!\" [Recipient Email]\n\n2. Dynamic content - Use Shell commands to change the content of the email based on the recipient's location or other factors. This can make the email more relevant and engaging. Here's an example command code to achieve this:\nif [Recipient Location] == \"New York\"; then\n    echo \"New York residents get an exclusive discount on our products! Click here to claim.\" | mail -s \"Exclusive offer for New York residents\" [Recipient Email]\nelse\n    echo \"Don't miss out on our amazing products! Click here to see what's new.\" | mail -s \"Check out our latest products\" [Recipient Email]\nfi\n\n3. A/B testing - Use Shell commands to split your email list into two groups and send them different versions of the email. This will allow you to see which version performs better and adjust your campaign accordingly. Here's an example command code to achieve this:\nif [ $(($RANDOM % 2)) == 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Option A - Check out our latest products!\" | mail -s \"New products just in - Option A\" [Recipient Email]\nelse\n    echo \"Option B - Get an exclusive discount on our products!\" | mail -s \"Exclusive offer inside - Option B\" [Recipient Email]\nfi\n\nPlease provide exactly 30 bullet points summarizing these email marketing optimization techniques.

Your goal is to optimize the campaign and increase the open and click-through rates as much as possible.\nTo achieve this, you need to incorporate some advanced and innovative techniques using Shell commands. Here are three techniques you can use:\n1. Personalized subject lines - By including the recipient's name or location in the subject line, you can grab their attention and make the email feel more personal. Use the following Shell command code to achieve this:\necho \"Hi [Recipient Name], check out this amazing offer!\" | mail -s \"[$Recipient Name] - Amazing offer inside!\" [Recipient Email]\n2. Dynamic content - Use Shell commands to change the content of the email based on the recipient's location or other factors. This can make the email more relevant and engaging. Here's an example command code to achieve this:\nif [Recipient Location] == \"New York\"; then\n    echo \"New York residents get an exclusive discount on our products! Click here to claim.\" | mail -s \"Exclusive offer for New York residents\" [Recipient Email]\nelse\n    echo \"Don't miss out on our amazing products! Click here to see what's new.\" | mail -s \"Check out our latest products\" [Recipient Email]\nfi\n3. A/B testing - Use Shell commands to split your email list into two groups and send them different versions of the email. This will allow you to see which version performs better and adjust your campaign accordingly. Here's an example command code to achieve this:\nif [ $(($RANDOM % 2)) == 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Option A - Check out our latest products!\" | mail -s \"New products just in - Option A\" [Recipient Email]\nelse\n    echo \"Option B - Get an exclusive discount on our products!\" | mail -s \"Exclusive offer inside - Option B\" [Recipient Email]\nfi\nBy using these advanced and innovative techniques, you can optimize your email marketing campaign and cater to your niche audience with limited resources. Good luck!",

The company produced light cars , voiturettes , and cabs at a factory in Charleville - Mézières ; it offered four - cylinder 10 and 12 hp engines .  - Charleville-Mézières is a commune in northern France, capital of the Ardennes department in the Grand Est region. Charleville-Mézières is located on the banks of the Meuse River.  - A voiturette is a miniature automobile. History. \"Voiturette\" was first registered by Léon Bollée in 1895 to name his new motor tricycle. The term became so popular in the early years of the motor industry that it was used by many makers to describe their small cars. The word comes from the French word for \"automobile\", \"voiture\". Between World War I and World War II light-weight racing cars with engines limited to 1500 cc such as the Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta, the Bugatti Type 13 and the original ERAs were known as voiturettes.    What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'roussel '?   Choices: - automobile manufacturer  - capital  - commune  - river\nAnswer:",

In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change?\n\nThe report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time.\n\nCourt costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents.\n\nThe evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department.\n\nFerguson's ugly, racist emails released\n\nThe recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.)\n\nWithout question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black.\n\nFerguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest.\n\nJackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson.\n\nBut does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nIndeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process.\n\nEqually important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns..\n\nThe Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nBut there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States.\n\nThat form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance.\n\nIn any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country.\n\nLikewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do.\n\nIt's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high.\n\nFerguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population.\n\nChange is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.",

For example, given {apple(noun), tree(noun), pick(verb)}, humans can easily come up with scenes like \"a boy is picking an apple from a tree\" via their generative commonsense reasoning ability. However, we find this capacity has not been well learned by machines. Most prior works in machine commonsense focus on discriminative reasoning tasks with a multi-choice question answering setting. Herein, we present CommonGen: a challenging dataset for testing generative commonsense reasoning with a constrained text generation task. We collect 37k concept-sets as inputs and 90k human-written sentences as associated outputs. Additionally, we also provide high-quality rationales behind the reasoning process for the development and test sets from the human annotators. We demonstrate the difficulty of the task by examining a wide range of sequence generation methods with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The state-of-the-art pre-trained generation model, UniLM, is still far from human performance in this task. Our data and code is publicly available at this http URL .\n\nIntroduction\nCommonsense reasoning has long been acknowledged as a critical bottleneck of artificial intelligence and especially in natural language processing. It is an ability of combining commonsense facts and logic rules to make new presumptions about ordinary scenes in our daily life. A distinct property of commonsense reasoning problems is that they are generally trivial for human-beings while challenging for machine reasoners.\nThere have been a few recent tasks and datasets for testing machine commonsense, while most of them frame their problems as multi-choice question answering, such as CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1. We name this kind of tasks as deterministic commonsense reasoning because they focus on modeling the plausibility of given complete scenes. The systems for these tasks thus have to work with biased selection of distractors, and thus are less practical or challenging. Simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF2. On the other hand, few work has been done so far in testing machine commonsense in a generative reasoning setting, where a reasoner is expected to complete scenes with several given concepts.\nSpecifically, we would like to investigate if machine-reasoning models can generate a sentence that contains a required set of concepts (i.e. nouns or verbs) while describing a common scene in our daily life. For example, as shown in Figure FIGREF1, given an unordered collection of concepts “{apple (noun), bag (noun), pick (verb), place (verb), tree (noun)}”, a rational reasoner should be able to generate a sentence like “A boy picks some apples from a tree and places them into a bag.”, which describes a natural scene and contains all given concepts. The creation of this sentence is easy for humans while non-trivial for even state-of-the-art conditional language generation models. We argue that such an ability of recovering natural scenes of daily life can benefit a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks including image/video captioning BIBREF3, BIBREF4, scene-based visual reasoning and VQA BIBREF5, storytelling BIBREF6, and dialogue systems BIBREF7, BIBREF8.\nTowards empowering machines with the generative commonsense reasoning ability, we create a large-scale dataset, named CommonGen, for the constrained text generation task. We collect $37,263$ concept-sets as the inputs, each of which contains three to five common concepts. These concept-sets are sampled from several large corpora of image/video captions, such that the concepts inside them are more likely to co-occur in natural scenes. Through crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we finally obtain $89,028$ human-written sentences as expected outputs. We investigate the performance of sophisticated sequence generation methods for the proposed task with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The experiments show that all methods are far from human performance in generative commonsense reasoning. Our main contributions are as follows: 1) We introduce the first large-scale constrained text generation dataset targeting at generative commonsense reasoning; 2) We systematically compare methods for this (lexically) constrained text generation with extensive experiments and evaluation. 3) Our code and data are publicly available (w/ the URL in the abstract), so future research in this direction can be directly developed in a unified framework.\n\nProblem Formulation\nIn this section, we formulate our task with mathematical notations and discuss its inherent challenges. The input to the task is a set of $n$ concepts $x=\\lbrace c_1,c_2,\\dots ,c_n\\rbrace \\in \\mathcal {X}$, where $c_i\\in \\mathcal {C}$ is a common noun or verb. $\\mathcal {X}$ denotes the space of concept-sets and $\\mathcal {C}$ stands for the concept vocabulary. The expected output of this task is a simple, grammatical sentence $y\\in \\mathcal {Y}$, describing a natural scene in our daily-life that covers all given concepts in $x$. Note that other forms of given concepts are also accepted, such as plural forms of nouns and verbs. In addition, we also provide rationales as an optional resource to model the generation process. For each pair of $(x, y)$, a rationale $r$ is a list of sentences that explains the background commonsense knowledge used in the scene recovering process.\nThe task is to learn a structured predictive function $f:\\mathcal {X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal {Y}$, which maps a concept-set to a sentence. Thus, it can be seen as a special case of constrained text generation BIBREF9. The unique challenges of our proposed task come from two main aspects as follows.\nConstrained Decoding. Lexically constrained decoding for sentence generation has been an important and challenging research topic in machine translation community BIBREF10, where they focus on how to decode sentences when some words/phrases (e.g. terminology) must present in target sentences (Section SECREF6). However, it is still an open problem how to efficiently generate sentences given an unordered set of multiple keywords with potential morphological changes (e.g. “pick” $\\rightarrow $ “picks” in the previous case). Apart from that, the part-of-speech constraints brings even more difficulties (e.g. “place” can be verb/noun).\nCommonsense Reasoning. Apart from the challenge in constrained decoding, a generative commonsense reasoner also has to compositionally use (latent) commonsense knowledge for generating most plausible scenes. Recall the illustrative example in Figure FIGREF1, even such a simple scene generation process needs pretty much commonsense knowledge like: 1) “apples grow in trees”; 2) “bags are containers that you can put something in”; 3) “you usually pick something and then place it in a container”. Expected reasoners have to prioritize target scenes over an infinity number of less plausible scenes like “A boy picks an apple tree and places it into bags.” or “A boy places some bags on a tree and picks an apple.”.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Crowd-Sourcing via AMT\nIt is true that the above-mentioned associated caption sentences for each concept-set are human-written and do describe scenes that cover all given concepts. However, they are created under specific contexts (i.e. an image or a video) and thus might be less representative for common sense. To better measure the quality and interpretability of generative reasoners, we need to evaluate them with scenes and rationales created by using concept-sets only as the signals for annotators.\nWe collect more human-written scenes for each concept-set in dev and test set through crowd-sourcing via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Each input concept-set is annotated by at least three different humans. The annotators are also required to give sentences as the rationales, which further encourage them to use common sense in creating their scenes. The crowd-sourced sentences correlate well with the associated captions, meaning that it is reasonable to use caption sentences as training data although they can be partly noisy. Additionally, we utilize a search engine over the OMCS corpus BIBREF16 for retrieving relevant propositions as distant rationales in training data.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Statistics\nWe present the statistical information of our final dataset. Firstly, we summarize the basic statistics in Table TABREF9, such as the number of unique concept-sets, scene sentences, and sentence lengths. In total, there are 3,706 unique concepts among all concept-sets, and 3,614/1,018/1,207 in the train/dev/test parts respectively. Note that there are 4% of the dev and 6% of the test concepts never appear in the training data, so we can better understand how well trained models can perform with unseen concepts.\nWe analyze the overlap between training concept-sets and dev/test concept-sets. By average, we find that 98.8% of the training instances share no common concept at all with dev/test data, such that the dev/test can help us analyze model performance on new combinations of concepts.\nWe also visualize the frequency distribution of our test concept-sets in Figure FIGREF7 by showing the frequency of top 50 single concepts and co-occurred concept pairs.\n\nMethods ::: Other methods\nBased on the similarity between our task and abstractive summarization and story generation (with given topic words), we also apply Pointer Generator Networks (“PointerGen”) BIBREF26 and Multi-scale Fusion Attention (“Fusion Attn.”) BIBREF27 model respectively for our task.\n\nEvaluation ::: Setup\nWe use the proposed CommonGen dataset in two setting: knowledge-agnostic and knowledge-aware. For the knowledge-agnostic setting, we simply apply the methods in Section SECREF4 while we concatenate rationales and input concept-sets together as the knowledge-aware inputs (“$+r$”).\n\nEvaluation ::: Automatic Metrics\nFor automatically evaluating our methods, we propose to use widely used metric for image/video captioning. This is because the proposed CommonGen task can be regarded as also a caption task where the context are incomplete scenes with given concept-sets. Therefore, we choose BLEU-3/4 BIBREF28, ROUGE-2/L BIBREF29, CIDEr BIBREF30, and SPICE BIBREF31 as the main metrics. Apart from these classic metrics, we also include a novel embedding-based metric named BERTScore BIBREF32. To make the comparisons more clear, we show the delta of BERTScore results by subtracting the score of merely using input concept-sets as target sentences, named $\\triangle $BERTS.\nTo have an estimation about human performance in each metric, we iteratively treat every reference sentence in dev/test data as the prediction to be compared with all references (including itself). That is, if a model has the same reasoning ability with average performance of our crowd workers, its results should exceed this “human bound”.\n\nEvaluation ::: Experimental Results\nWe present the experimental results of five groups of methods that are introduced in Section SECREF4. We find that the model UniLM outperforms all other baseline methods by a large margin, which is expected due to it is pre-trained with the BERT encoder towards generation objectives. However, its performance is still way far from the human bound, and this margin is even larger in test data.\nWe notice that the most recent edit-based model named LevenTrans archives the best performance among models without pre-training at all. This shows that edit-based sequence generation models can better deal with the cases where target sentences share similar vocabulary with source ones. Nonetheless, the other two models within the same sequence modeling framework (i.e. fairseq) are much worse, which might because of their specialty designed for machine translation.\nAn order-insensitive sequence/set encoder, “mean encoder”, outperform order-sensitive counterparts like “bRNN”. However, such a marginal improvement is not seen in the comparison between “Trans.” vs “Trans. w/o Pos”. We assume that for short sequences the order sensitivity does not harm sequential encoders, while positional embeddings in Transformers can better improve the self-attention mechanism. Also, we find that Transformer-based seq2seq architectures are not outperforming simpler models like bRNN.\nAs for the use of additional retrieved sentences form OMCS corpus and human-written associated rationales, we find that they are not generally helpful in investigated architectures. Although they increase the BLEU and ROUGE scores, the metrics specially designed for captioning like CIDEr and SPICE are dropping down. We argue that it might because the OMCS sentences are actually not aligned with training data, and more sophisticated methods for encoding such non-sequential facts in a more compositional way.\n\nEvaluation ::: Qualitative Analysis\nFor more clearly observe the performance of interested models, we present several real system outputs on the test set in Table TABREF24. We find that models usually cannot cover all given concepts, and also can produce repetitions of given concepts (e.g. “a dog catches a dog”, “a couple of couples”, and “at an object and an object .”). Moreover, we find that the order of actions may be mot natural. For example, the model output “a man pulls a sword out of his mouth and swallows it” makes less sense because a man usually swallow a sword first before he pull it out in such performances.\n\nRelated Work ::: Machine Common Sense\nMachine common sense (MCS) has long been considered as one of the most significant area in artificial intelligence. Recently, there are various emerging datasets for testing machine commonsense from different angles, such as commonsense extraction BIBREF33, BIBREF34, next situation prediction (SWAG BIBREF1, CODAH BIBREF35, HellaSWAG BIBREF36), cultural/social understanding BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39, visual scene comprehension BIBREF40, and general commonsense question answering BIBREF0, BIBREF41. Most of them are in a multi-choice QA setting for discriminative commonsense reasoning, among which CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1 are two typical examples. The input of the CSQA task is a question that needs commonsense reasoning and there are five candidate answers (words/phrases). The SWAG task asks models to select which situation is the most plausible next situation, given a sentence describing an event.\nThe two tasks share very similar objectives with large pre-trained language encoders like BERT BIBREF42: Masked-LM can predict the missing words in an incomplete sentence, which is similar to the CSQA setting; NextSentPrediction classifies whether a sentence is the next sentence of the given sentence in the corpora, which can be seen as using distant supervision for the SWAG task. Thus, simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF43, BIBREF2, but it does not necessarily mean machine reasoners can really produce new assumptions in an open and generative setting. The proposed CommonGen, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dataset and task for generative commonsense reasoning.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we purpose a novel constrained text generation task for generative commonsense reasoning. We introduce a new large-scale dataset named CommonGen and investigate various methods on them. Through our extensive experiments and human evaluation, we demonstrate that the inherent difficulties of the new task cannot be addressed by even the state-of-the-art pre-trained language generation model.\nFor the future research, we believe the following directions are highly valuable to explore: 1) specially designed metrics for automatic evaluation that focus on commonsense plausibility; 2) better mechanisms for retrieving and imposing useful commonsense knowledge into sentence generation processes; 3) explicitly modeling keyword-centric edits (e.g. insertion, deletion, morphological changes) such that relevant commonsense knowledge can be well utilized. We also believe that models performed well on CommonGen can be easily transferred to other commonsense-required reasoning tasks with few annotations, including image/video captioning, visual question answering, and discriminative multi-choice commonsense question answering.\n\nFigure 1: A motivating example for generative commonsense reasoning and the COMMONGEN task.

Moammar Gadhafi affixed to a shoe—a sign of deep disrespect in the Arab world.\n\nForces loyal to strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi imposed rough order in Libya's increasingly fearful capital Wednesday, witnesses said, that stood in sharp contrast to rebel gains in much of the oil-rich country.\n\nGunshots echoed through the night in Tripoli as Col. Gadhafi clung to power even as the international community discussed ways to isolate him with sanctions. More territory slipped from his control, and rebels began to set up rudimentary governments in outlying areas under their sway. \"No-one should count him out, but momentum isn't going his way,\" a U.S. official said.\n\nThe chaos that has consumed Libya since protesters last week began pushing for Col. Gadhafi's ouster has spawned an array of security concerns—over oil supplies, the safety of tens of thousands of foreign workers there and the risks posed by the weapons in Col. Gadhafi's remaining arsenal.\n\nOil prices surged over fears about the security of supplies from Libya, a major oil producer. Prices for light, sweet crude for April delivery—the main U.S. oil contract—at one point in the trading day hit $100 a barrel for the first time in more than two years.\n\nThe U.S., China, Turkey and several European nations struggled to bring home citizens stranded in Libya, where an estimated 100,000 foreigners work in industries including oil and construction. Airplanes sent from France and the Netherlands circled Tripoli's airport but had no clearance to land and turned back.\n\nFears also arose in Washington that Libya's regime hasn't destroyed significant stockpiles of mustard gas and other chemical-weapons agents.

Video and image courtesy of Reuters.\n\nPresident Barack Obama sharply condemned the violence. \"The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable,\" he said in his first public comments on the growing unrest in Libya. He said the Libyan government must \"face the cost of continued violations of human rights.\"\n\nMr. Obama said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would go to Geneva for international talks aimed at finding ways to halt the violence. He said his administration would draw up a full range of options to respond to the crisis.\n\nThe White House emphasis is on sanctions, unilateral and multilateral, which could include freezing Libyan government assets, halting foreign investment and imposing travel restrictions on officials. U.S. and other officials are looking at imposing a no-fly zone, but it appears less likely.\n\nFrance and Germany called for the European Union to consider suspending economic, commercial and financial relations with Libya.\n\nOpponents of Col.

Pro-Gadhafi groups have set up roadblocks around the capital, residents said Wednesday, adding that groups of plainclothes security agents are stepping up their hunt for those considered disloyal to the regime.\n\nOne resident said his friend had gone into hiding after group of plainclothes security agents in a brown Toyota pickup truck arrived at his home to arrest him. The friend, this person said, had been making celebratory phone calls to friends and family.\n\nMany who participated in antiregime demonstrations Sunday in Tripoli said they were scared to go back out on the streets. Some said they have received anonymous text messages saying they would be shot if they start another demonstration. Overnight Wednesday, residents said heavy gunfire could be heard in the upscale Ben Ashoura neighborhood, home to many diplomatic buildings.\n\nThe melting away of Mr. Gadhafi's government—at least a half-dozen have defected or quit in recent days—has added to the relative power of Libya's many tribes, which are spread across the country with each claiming the fealty of thousands of members.\n\nSince seizing power in 1969, Col. Gadhafi has maintained his rule in part by dividing and conquering Libya's tribes, and by periodically overhauling the government to deprive potential political rivals a base. The resulting power structure is a hodgepodge of ineffective bureaucracies and competing organizations.\n\nSee some key dates in Col. Gadhafi's nearly 42-year reign.\n\nProtetsers demonstrated against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in Tobruq Wednesday.\n\n\"What he created was a system of chaos, committees on top of committees reporting to committees and overseen by thugs,\" said Hafed al-Ghwell, a Libyan opposition activist. \"My biggest fear is that you have no real institutions on a national level that can impose order, and what we are looking at is the prospect of a collapsed state on the Mediterranean Sea—with oil, no central command or institutions able to stand up and help the transition into a civilian democratic rule.\"\n\nAbove the technocrats and bloated rolls of civil servants sit \"revolutionary committees\" — part political commissars, part enforcers of the leader's law and order, according to political analysts. The committees, populated largely with Col. Gadhafi's clan members, are responsible for ensuring citizens' loyalty and promoting the leader's ideology.\n\nThe groups exist on local and regional levels and their members receive generous benefits, including housing and cars.

They have spent years destroying the base within the military that the rival Warfalla tribe once had, say Libyans with knowledge of the situation.\n\nBut by wiping out allegiances to anyone besides himself, Col.

Nurses should pay attention to the psychological needs of depressive patients by participating in an application of non-pharmacological treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive-behavioral group therapy on depression in patients with diabetes.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This randomized controlled trial was performed in 2010 in the diabetes clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, southern Iran. In this study, 60 eligible patients suffering from depression were randomly divided into two groups by convenience sampling method, using random block allocation. The experimental group was randomly subdivided into three groups of 10 each and received eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy. The level of depression was checked before as well as 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 months after the intervention in both groups. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was also checked before and 2 months after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Both groups were demographically homogeneous with no statistically significant difference. The trend in depression scores before as well as 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 months after the intervention was statistically significant in the experimental group (P ≤ 0.001), but not in the control group (P = 0.087). The results showed that HbA1c variation was statistically significant before and after the intervention in both groups (P ≤ 0.001). However, the mean variation of HbA1c was not statistically significant between the groups (P = 0.473).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Cognitive-behavioral group therapy was effective in reducing depression in patients with diabetes.

The term 'work' is too vague and doesn't specify a location type. An industrial complex typically focuses on manufacturing and production facilities rather than office spaces. New York is a specific city rather than a general category of location. Suburbia usually consists of residential areas with scattered commercial buildings. However, a city represents the most comprehensive answer as urban areas naturally concentrate office buildings due to business needs, infrastructure, and economic factors. Cities provide the necessary framework for multiple office buildings including zoning laws, transportation networks, and business districts. The downtown core of any major city typically houses numerous office towers and commercial buildings. Financial districts within cities are specifically designed to accommodate multiple office structures. Cities offer the population density and economic activity that supports numerous office buildings. Urban planning in cities deliberately creates commercial zones where office buildings cluster together. The infrastructure in cities supports the utilities and services that office buildings require. Cities provide the workforce that fills these office buildings through public transportation and accessibility. Real estate development in cities focuses heavily on commercial office space due to demand. Cities have the regulatory framework and building codes necessary for large office construction. The economic ecosystem of cities creates demand for various types of office buildings from small to large corporations. Therefore, the correct answer is C. city.",

We evaluated whether setting the PEEP using decremental PEEP titration after an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre (ARM) affects the clinical outcome in patients with ARDS.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with early ARDS were randomly assigned to a group given decremental PEEP titration following ARM or a table-based PEEP (control) group. PEEP and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) in the control group were set according to the table-based combinations of FiO2 and PEEP of the ARDS network, by which we aimed to achieve a PEEP level compatible with an oxygenation target. In the decremental PEEP titration group, the oxygen saturation and static compliance were monitored as the patients performed the ARM along with the extended sigh method, which is designed to gradually apply and withdraw a high distending pressure over a prolonged period, and the decremental titration of PEEP.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the control and decremental PEEP titration groups. Initial oxygenation improved more in the decremental PEEP titration group than in the control group. However, dynamic compliance, tidal volume and PEEP were similar in the two groups during the first week. The duration of use of paralysing or sedative agents, mechanical ventilation, stay in the intensive care unit and mortality at 28 days did not differ significantly between the decremental PEEP titration and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM showed only initial oxygenation improvement compared with the table-based PEEP method. Respiratory mechanics and patient outcomes did not differ between the decremental PEEP titration and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ISRCTN79027921.",

Techniques such as distant and weak supervision can be used to create labeled data in a (semi-) automatic way. Additionally, to alleviate some of the negative effects of the errors in automatic annotation, noise-handling methods can be integrated. Pretrained word embeddings are another key component of most neural named entity classifiers. With the advent of more complex contextual word embeddings, an interesting trade-off between model size and performance arises. While these techniques have been shown to work well in high-resource settings, we want to study how they perform in low-resource scenarios. In this work, we perform named entity recognition for Hausa and Yor\\`ub\\'a, two languages that are widely spoken in several developing countries. We evaluate different embedding approaches and show that distant supervision can be successfully leveraged in a realistic low-resource scenario where it can more than double a classifier's performance.\n\nIntroduction\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a classification task that identifies words in a text that refer to entities (such as dates, person, organization and location names). It is a core task of natural language processing and a component for many downstream applications like search engines, knowledge graphs and personal assistants. For high-resource languages like English, this is a well-studied problem with complex state-of-the-art systems reaching close to or above 90% F1-score on the standard datasets CoNLL03 BIBREF0 and Ontonotes BIBREF1. In recent years, research has been extended to a larger pool of languages including those of developing countries BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Often, for these languages (like Hausa and Yorùbá studied here), there exists a large population with access to digital devices and internet (and therefore digital text), but natural language processing (NLP) tools do not support them.\nOne key reason is the absence of labeled training data required to train these systems. While manually labeled, gold-standard data is often only available in small quantities, it tends to be much easier to obtain large amounts of unlabeled text. Distant and weak supervision methods can then be used to create labeled data in a (semi-) automatic way. Using context BIBREF6, BIBREF7, external knowledge and resources BIBREF8, BIBREF9, expert rules BIBREF10, BIBREF11 or self-training BIBREF12, BIBREF13, a corpus or dataset can be labeled quickly and cheaply. Additionally, a variety of noise-handling methods have been proposed to circumvent the negative effects that errors in this automatic annotation might have on the performance of a machine learning classifier.\nIn this work, we study two methods of distant supervision for NER: Automatic annotation rules and matching of lists of entities from an external knowledge source. While distant supervision has been successfully used for high resource languages, it is not straight forward that these also work in low-resource settings where the amount of available external information might be much lower. The knowledge graph of Wikidata e.g. contains 4 million person names in English while only 32 thousand such names are available in Yorùbá, many of which are Western names.\nOrthogonally to distant supervision, the pre-training of word embeddings is a key component for training many neural NLP models. A vector representation for words is built in an unsupervised fashion, i.e. on unlabeled text. Standard embedding techniques include Word2Vec BIBREF14, GloVe BIBREF15 and FastText BIBREF16. In the last two years, contextualized word embeddings have been proposed BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19. At the cost of having a much larger model size, these vector representations take the context of words into account and have been shown to outperform other embeddings in many tasks. In this study, we evaluate both types of representations.\nThe key questions we are interested in this paper are: How do NER models perform for Hausa and Yorùbá, two languages from developing countries? Are distant-supervision techniques relying on external information also useful in low-resource settings? How do simple and contextual word embeddings trade-off in model size and performance?\n\nBackground & Methods ::: Datasets & Embeddings\nThe Hausa data used in this paper is part of the LORELEI language pack. It consists of Broad Operational Language Translation (BOLT) data gathered from news sites, forums, weblogs, Wikipedia articles and twitter messages. We use a split of 10k training and 1k test instances. Due to the Hausa data not being publicly available at the time of writing, we could only perform a limited set of experiments on it.\nThe Yorùbá NER data used in this work is the annotated corpus of Global Voices news articles recently released by BIBREF22. The dataset consists of 1,101 sentences (26k tokens) divided into 709 training sentences, 113 validation sentences and 279 test sentences based on 65%/10%/25% split ratio. The named entities in the dataset are personal names (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC) and date & time (DATE). All other tokens are assigned a tag of \"O\".\nFor the Yorùbá NER training, we make use of Yorùbá FastText embeddings BIBREF22 and multilingual-BERT that was trained on 104 languages including Yorùbá. Instead of the original FastText embeddings BIBREF16, we chose FastText embeddings trained on a multi-domain and high-quality dataset BIBREF22 because it gave better word similarity scores.\n\nBackground & Methods ::: Distant and Weak Supervision\nIn this work, we rely on two sources of distant supervision chosen for its ease of application:\nRules allow to apply the knowledge of domain experts without the manual effort of labeling each instance. They are especially suited for entities that follow specific patterns, like time phrases in text (see also BIBREF23). We use them for the DATE entity. In Yoruba, date expressions are written with the keywords of “ọj” (day), “oṣù” (month), and “ọdn” (year). Similarly, time expressions are written with keywords such as “wákàtí” (hour), “ìṣjú (minute) and “ìṣjú-aaya (seconds). Relative date and time expressions are also written with keywords “ḷodn” (in the year), “loṣù” (in the month), “lọs” (in the week), “lọj” (in the day). An example of a date expression is:\n“8th of December, 2018” in Yorùbá translates to “ọj 8 oṣù Ọp, ọdún 2018”\nLists of Entities can be obtained from a variety of sources like gazetteers, dictionaries, phone books, census data and Wikipedia categories BIBREF24. In recent years, knowledge bases like Freebase and Wikidata have become another option to retrieve entity lists in a structured way. An entity list is created by extracting all names of that type from a knowledge source (e.g. all person names from Wikidata). If a word or token from the unlabeled text matches an entry in an entity list, it is assigned the corresponding label. Experts can add heuristics to this automatic labeling that improve the matching BIBREF25. These include e.g. normalizing the grammatical form of words or filtering common false positives.\nAnother popular method for low-resource NER is the use of cross-lingual information BIBREF26. Alternatives to distant supervision are crowd-sourcing BIBREF27 and non-expert annotations BIBREF28.\n\nBackground & Methods ::: Learning With Noisy Labels\nThe labels obtained through distant and weak supervision methods tend to contain a high amount of errors. In the Food101N dataset BIBREF29 around 20% of the automatically obtained labels are incorrect while for Clothing1M BIBREF30 the noise rate is more than 60%. Learning with this additional, noisily labeled data can result in lower classification performance compared to just training on a small set of clean labels (cf. e.g. BIBREF31). A variety of techniques have been proposed to handle label noise like modelling the underlying noise process BIBREF32 and filtering noisy instances BIBREF33, BIBREF34. BIBREF35 gives an in-depth introduction into this field and BIBREF36 survey more recent approaches, focusing on the vision domain.\nIn this work, we experiment with three noise handling techniques. The approach by BIBREF37 estimates a noise channel using the EM algorithm. It treats all labels as possibly noisy and does not distinguish between a clean and a noisy part of the data. In contrast, the method by BIBREF38 leverages the existence of a small set of gold standard labels, something that - in our experience - is often available even in low resource settings. Having such a small set of clean labels is beneficial both for the main model itself as well as for the noise handling technique. Both approaches model the relationship between clean and noisy labels using a confusion matrix. This allows adapting the noisy to the clean label distribution during training. For a setting with 5 labels, it only requires $5^2=25$ additional parameters to estimate which could be beneficial when only few training data is available. The technique by BIBREF39 (adapted to NER by BIBREF38) learns a more complex neural network to clean the noisy labels before training with them. It also takes the features into account when cleaning the noise and it might, therefore, be able to model more complex noise processes. All three techniques can be easily added to the existing standard neural network architectures for NER.\n\nModels & Experimental Settings\nHausa Distant supervision on Hausa was performed using lists of person names extracted from Wikipedia data. Since we had limited access to the data, we tested a simplified binary NER-tagging setting (PERSON-tags only). As a base model, we used a Bi-LSTM model developed for Part-of-Speech tagging BIBREF40. For noise handling, we apply the Noise Channel model by BIBREF37.\nYorùbá For Yorùbá, the entity lists were created by extracting person, location and organization entities from Wikidata in English and Yorùbá. Additionally, a list of person names in Nigeria was obtained from a Yorùbá Name website (8,365 names) and list of popular Hausa, Igbo, Fulani and Yorùbá people on Wikipedia (in total 9,241 names). As manual heuristic, a minimum name length of 2 was set for extraction of PER (except for Nigerian names), LOC and ORG. The Nigerian names were set to include names with a minimum length of 3. For the DATE label, a native Yorùbá speaker wrote some annotation rules using 11 “date keywords” (“ọj”, “ọs”, “os”, “ọdn”, “wákàtí” , “ḷodn”, “ḷodn-un”, “ọdn-un” “lọs” , “lọj”, “ aago”) following these two criteria: (1) A token is a date keyword or follows a date keyword in a sequence. (2) A token is a digit. For Yorùbá, we evaluate four settings with different amounts of clean data, namely 1k, 2k, 4k and the full dataset. As distantly supervised data with noisy labels, the full dataset is used. Additionally, 19,559 words from 18 articles of the Global News Corpus (different from the articles in the training corpus) were automatically annotated.\nThe Bi-LSTM model consists of a Bi-LSTM layer followed by a linear layer to extract input features. The Bi-LSTM layer has a 300-dimensional hidden state for each direction. For the final classification, an additional linear layer is added to output predicted class distributions. For noise handling, we experiment with the Confusion Matrix model by BIBREF38 and the Cleaning model by BIBREF39. We repeat all the Bi-LSTM experiments 20 times and report the average F1-score (following the approach by BIBREF41) and the standard error.\nThe BERT model is obtained by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT embeddings on NER data with an additional untrained CRF classifier. We fine-tuned all the parameters of BERT including that of the CRF end-to-end. This has been shown to give better performance than using word features extracted from BERT to train a classifier BIBREF19. The evaluation result is obtained as an average of 5 runs, we report the F1-score and the standard error in the result section.\n\nResults\nThe results for Hausa are given in Table TABREF14. Training with a mix of 50% clean and 50% distantly-supervised data performs 15 F1-score points below using the whole 100% clean data which is to be expected due to the lower quality of the distantly-supervised labels. Using the Noise Channel closes half of this gap. Due to the limited availability of the dataset, we could unfortunately not investigate this further, but it shows already the benefits that are possible through noise-handling.\nAn evaluation of the distant supervision for Yorùbá is given in Table TABREF14. The quality of the automatically annotated labels differs between the classes. Locations perform better than person and organization names, probably due to locations being less diverse and better covered in Wikidata. With simple date rules, we obtain already a 48% F1-score. This shows the importance of leveraging the knowledge of native speakers in automatic annotations. Overall a decent annotation can be obtained by the distant supervision and it even outperforms some of the actual machine learning models in the low-resource setting. Table TABREF14 compares using only Wikidata as data source versus adding additional, manually obtained lists of person names. While adding a list of Yorùbá names only improves recall slightly, the integration of Nigerian names helps to boost recall by 13 points.\nThe experimental results for Yorùbá are given in Figure FIGREF11. The setting differs from the experiments with Hausa in that there is a small clean training set and additional, distantly-supervised data. For the Bi-LSTM model, adding distantly-supervised labels always helps. In the low-resource settings with 1k and 2k labeled data, it more than doubles the performance. Handling the noise in the distant supervision can result in slight improvements. The noise-cleaning approach struggles somewhat while the confusion matrix architecture does give better results in the majority of the scenarios. Training on 5k labeled data with distantly supervised data and noise handling, one can obtain a performance close to using the full 17k manually labeled token.\nThe Bi-LSTM model has 1.50 million parameters (1.53 million for the cleaning model), while BERT has 110 million parameters. There is a clear trade-off between model size and performance. The BERT model is 70 times larger and obtains consistently better results due to its more complex, contextual embeddings pretrained on more data. Still, the F1-score also drops nearly half for the BERT model in the 1k setting compared to the full dataset. For 1k and 2k labeled data, the distant supervision helps to improve the model's performance. However, once the model trained only on clean data reaches a higher F1-score than the distant supervision technique, the model trained on clean and distantly-supervised data deteriorates. This suggests that the BERT model overfits too much on the noise in the distant supervision.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe experiments on Hausa were possible thanks to the collaboration with Florian Metze and CMU as part of the LORELEI project.

The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires.  Paragraph: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A.

                "content": "Background: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.  Paragraph: Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is Bobby's garden at more or less risk of hypoxia than Ned's garden?\nAns: less\n\nBackground: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]  Paragraph: Booneland changed their foreign exchange controls and Bradland didn't. The foreign currency got more expensive and they had problems with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks, but didn't have those problems.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had people that were more cautious?\nAns: Bradland\n\nBackground: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Paragraph: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer people that consistently consumed more food energy then they need?\nAns: Group A\n\nBackground: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires.  Paragraph: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A.

Article: From my father I have learned a lot. And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \"May I help you?\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians.

Thompson lived in an apartment in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Just before his senior year, his family moved to Westport, Massachusetts, where he received a Teenager of the Year award—the title of a later solo album. During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including \"Here Comes Your Man\" from Doolittle, and \"Velvety Instrumental Version.\"After graduating from high school in 1983, Thompson studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in anthropology. Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a semester before moving in with future Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago. The two shared an interest in rock music, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie; they began to jam together. It was at this time that Thompson discovered The Cars, a band he described as \"very influential on me and the Pixies.\"In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, as part of an exchange program. He spent six months in an apartment with a \"weird, psycho roommate,\" who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song \"Crackity Jones;\" many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view Halley's Comet (he later said it \"seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time\"), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words \"we gotta do it, now is the time Joe,\" to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.\n----\nAnswer: Thompson\nQ: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose lyrics were compared to the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod?  May 3, 2006, was the premiere of Dylan's radio presenting career, hosting a weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour, for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around a chosen theme. Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and the Streets. The show was praised by fans and critics as \"great radio,\" as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices. In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh\". This led to speculation that Dylan's radio excursion had ended. On August 29, 2006, Dylan released his Modern Times album. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as \"a catarrhal death rattle\") most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and \"Love and Theft\". Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire. The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.Nominated for three Grammy Awards, Modern Times won Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album and Bob Dylan also won Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Someday Baby\". Modern Times was named Album of the Year, 2006, by Rolling Stone magazine, and by Uncut in the UK. On the same day that Modern Times was released the iTunes Music Store released Bob Dylan: The Collection, a digital box set containing all of his albums (773 tracks in total), along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.In August 2007, the award-winning film biography of Dylan I'm Not There, written and directed by Todd Haynes, was...\nA: Bob\nProblem: Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who are celebrating their 16th anniversary?  1953: Through the course of a Colorado autumn and winter, Mary Spencer and Fred Wilson lead an idyllic existence. Mary drops out of college (with 6 months to go) to marry Fred. Their perfect wedding mirrors the happy endings of the films Mary loves. 1969: It is the Wilsons' 16th wedding anniversary. On his way to work, Fred, a successful tax consultant, tells their maid Agnes that he has found vodka hidden in Mary's wardrobe and asks Agnes to keep an eye on his wife. Mary sets out for the beauty parlour. At an airline office, however, Mary buys a one-way ticket to Nassau, Bahamas looking for an escape from her dull and unhappy suburban life. On the flight she recalls the horrors of last year's anniversary party, when Fred had drunkenly flirted with a blond divorcee, and she had taken refuge in the bottle and a rerun of Casablanca. At a stop-over, she calls home and learns this year's anniversary party has been a different sort of disaster. Her teenage daughter Marge is scared by Mary's call, as it reminds her of the time she had found her mother unconscious after an overdose. En route to Nassau, Mary meets Flo, an old college friend she has not seen since 1953. While Mary settled down to married life, Flo has been the mistress of a series of married men and lives a rather carefree and hedonistic lifestyle and has fully embraced the sexual revolution. She is on her way to Nassau to meet her latest beau, Sam. Mary tells her she has had to get away from Fred, so Flo promises to look after her.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n Give two different responses.

So in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 12 = 18 minutes. This means the final part of the journey took him 18 / 3 = 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 18 + 6 = 24 minutes. In the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = 28 minutes. So the second route takes a total of 28 + 14 = 42 minutes to walk. The second route therefore takes an extra 42 minutes for the second route – 24 minutes for the first route = 18 minutes.\nThe answer: 18\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Malcolm is trying to find the fastest walk to school and is currently comparing two routes. In the first route, he walks for 6 minutes uphill, walks for twice this amount of time along a path, then finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages.

If these are the only animals in the zoo, how many animals are in the zoo?\nReasoning and answer: Let M be the number of square feet in Matha's bedroom. Jenny's bedroom is M + 60 square feet. M + M + 60 = 300. 2M + 60 = 300. 2M = 240. M = 120. Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.\nThe answer: 120\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Your response must have 30 sections.

Please summarize the key findings of the work in 1-2 sentences.\n\nPaper text: We propose an effective multitask learning setup for reducing distant supervision noise by leveraging sentence-level supervision.\nWe show how sentence-level supervision can be used to improve the encoding of individual sentences, and to learn which input sentences are more likely to express the relationship between a pair of entities.\nWe also introduce a novel neural architecture for collecting signals from multiple input sentences, which combines the benefits of attention and maxpooling.\nThe proposed method increases AUC by 10% (from 0.261 to 0.284), and outperforms recently published results on the FB-NYT dataset.\nEarly work in relation extraction from text used fully supervised methods, e.g., BID2 , which motivated the development of relatively small datasets with sentence-level annotations such as ACE 2004 BID2 , BioInfer and SemEval 2010 .\nRecognizing the difficulty of annotating text with relations, especially when the number of relation types of interest is large, BID16 pioneered the distant supervision approach to relation extraction, where a knowledge base (KB) and a text corpus are used to automatically generate a large dataset of labeled sentences which is then used to train a relation classifier.\nDistant supervision provides a practical alternative to manual annotations, but introduces many noisy examples.\nAlthough many methods have been proposed to reduce the noise in distantly supervised models for relation extraction (e.g., BID8 BID23 BID22 BID5 BID27 BID11 , a rather obvious approach has been understudied: using sentence-level supervision to augment distant supervision.\nIntuitively, supervision at the sentence-level can help reduce the noise in distantly supervised models by identifying which of the input sentences for a given pair of entities are likely to express a relation.We experiment with a variety of model architectures to combine sentence-and bag-level supervision and find it most effective to use the sentence-level annotations to directly supervise the sentence encoder component of the model in a multi-task learning framework.\nWe also introduce a novel maxpooling attention architecture for combining the evidence provided by different sentences where the entity pair is mentioned, and use the sentence-level annotations to supervise attention weights.The contributions of this paper are as follows:• We propose an effective multitask learning setup for reducing distant supervision noise by leveraging existing datasets of relations annotated at the sentence level.•\nWe propose maxpooled attention, a neural architecture which combines the benefits of maxpooling and soft attention, and show that it helps the model combine information about a pair of entities from multiple sentences.•\nWe release our library for relation extraction as open source. 1\nThe following section defines the notation we use, describes the problem and provides an overview of our approach.\nWe propose two complementary methods to improve performance and reduce noise in distantly supervised relation extraction.\nThe first is incorporating sentence-level supervision and the second is maxpooled attention, a novel form of attention.\nThe sentence-level supervision improves sentence encoding and provides supervision for attention weights, while maxpooled attention effectively combines sentence encodings and their weights into a bag encoding.\nOur experiments show a 10% improvement in AUC (from 0.261 to 0.284) outperforming recently published results on the FB-NYT dataset .\n\nSummary:  Your answer must contain exactly 3 bullet points.

When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone-Goebel alliance.  Goebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the \"Honest Election Democrats\" held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor.  Republican William S. Taylor defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2-1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war.\n\nAnswer this question \"What else is significant about this election?\" by extracting the answer from the text above.",

Plot title: Forty-Ninth Parallel Movie plot: Early in the Second World War, U-37, a German U-boat, makes its way to Canadian waters and participates in fictional anti-shipping activities similar to those that would later characterize the Battle of the St. Lawrence (which occurred in actuality some time after the film's release). The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold. The story comes to a head with a confrontation on a goods train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive and absent-without-leave Canadian soldier Andy Brock (Raymond Massey).

Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall and leave Scotland. He leaves and joins the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.

In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.  On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B?\\nAnswer: side B\\n\\n\\n[Q]: James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection.

The primary outcome included incidences of 1) isoniazid-related liver injury (INH-DILI) during the first 8 weeks of therapy, and 2) early treatment failure as indicated by a persistent positive culture or no improvement in chest radiographs at the8th week.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two Japanese patients (slow acetylators, 9.3 %; rapid acetylators, 53.5 %) were enrolled in this trial. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, INH-DILI occurred in 78 % of the slow acetylators in the STD-treatment, while none of the slow acetylators in the PGx-treatment experienced either INH-DILI or early treatment failure. Among the rapid acetylators, early treatment failure was observed with a significantly lower incidence rate in the PGx-treatment than in the STD-treatment (15.0 % vs. 38 %). Thus, the NAT2 genotype-guided regimen resulted in much lower incidences of unfavorable events, INH-DILI or early treatment failure, than the conventional standard regimen.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Our results clearly indicate a great potential of the NAT2 genotype-guided dosing stratification of isoniazid in chemotherapy for tuberculosis.",

Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\n[Answer]She uses 3 ounces of beans per day because 2 x 1.5 = 3. She uses 21 ounces of beans per week because 7 x 3 = 21. She buys 2 bags of beans per week because 21 / 10.5 = 2. She spends $16 on the beans per week because 2 x 8 = 16. She spends $2 on the milk per week because 4 x (1 / 2) = 2. She spends $18 per week on her coffee because 16 + 2 = 18. The answer is 18.\nQ: Gabby planted a watermelon vine, a peach tree, and two plum trees in the spring. Over the summer, the plants grew and produced fruit. She only got one watermelon to grow, but she got twelve more peaches than that, and three times that number of plums. How many pieces of fruit did Gabby get to pick that summer?\nA: Gabby's peach tree grew 12 + 1 = 13 peaches. Her plum trees grew 13 * 3 = 39 plums. Thus, Gabby got 1 + 13 + 39 = 53 pieces of fruit to pick. The answer is 53.\nQuestion: Aubriella is pouring water into a 50-gallon fish tank at the rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds. How many more gallons will she have to pour into the tank to fill the tank if she poured water into the fish tank for 6 minutes?\nAnswer: When she poured water into the gallon for 6 minutes, the total time in seconds she took is 6 minutes * 60 seconds / minute = 360 seconds. If in 20 seconds she poured 1 gallon of water into the tank, in 360 seconds, she poured 360 seconds / 20 seconds / gallon = 18 gallons of water into the tank. Aubriella will have to pour 50 gallons - 18 gallons = 32 more gallons into the tank to fill the tank. The answer is 32.\n[Question]Miggy's mom brought home 3 bags of birthday hats. Each bag has 15 hats. Miggy accidentally tore off 5 hats. During the party, only 25 hats were used. How many hats were unused?\n[Answer]There are a total of 15 x 3 = 45 hats in 3 bags. Since 5 tore off, only 45 - 5 = 40 hats were left. Thus, 40 - 25 = 15 hats were unused. The answer is 15.\nQ: James buys 200 lotto tickets for 2 dollars each. Of those tickets 20% are winners. 80% of the winners are for 5 dollars. 1 ticket is the grand prize of $5,000. The other tickets win an average of $10. How much did he profit?\nA: He spent 200 * 2 = $400. There were 200 * .2 = 40 tickets. Of those 40 * .8 = 32 are 5 dollar winners. So they win 32 * 5 = $160. He has 40 - 32 = 8 other winning tickets. Of those 8 - 1 = 7 wins $10. So they win 10 * 7 = $70. So he won 5000 + 70 + 160 - 400 = $4830. The answer is 4830.\nQuestion: Randy drew 5 pictures. Peter drew 3 more pictures than Randy.

It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. After the end of the story, Lanni probably:  A. decides to go into social work  B. decides to be an actor  C. continues his job as a web developer  D. not enough information\nC\n\n\n(Question)\nAs a nurse, what is the most difficult news you have ever had to break to a patient? Sadly in my job (Ob/gyn nurse) there is one thing I have to report fairly often, that a pregnancy is not going to happen. Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining. Nothing is worse than the look on a woman’s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it. My own daughter called me one day to announce she was pregnant and two days later, we found out she was miscarrying and I bawled all day. I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water. I have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don’t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news. If they call me for their lab results, they might be driving, they might be walking around the mall, they will have to call their significant other and break the news, such difficult conversations to have over the phone. I have been very, very lucky that the few times I have seen advanced pregnancies that underwent a fetal demise were handled by the physicians that I have worked with. I can’t imagine being almost ready to deliver and having all your hopes and dreams crushed. Obstetricians sometimes have the very best job, bringing new lives into the world and seeing the new families bonding, but sometimes they also have the very worst job. Why might a woman expect that her pregnancy is going to end?  A. She is bleeding  B. She is walking around the mall  C. She is driving  D. not enough information\n(Answer)\n Your answer must contain exactly 26 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as: * This is a point.",

Please summarize the key findings of the work in 1-2 sentences.\n\nPaper text: We propose an effective multitask learning setup for reducing distant supervision noise by leveraging sentence-level supervision.\nWe show how sentence-level supervision can be used to improve the encoding of individual sentences, and to learn which input sentences are more likely to express the relationship between a pair of entities.\nWe also introduce a novel neural architecture for collecting signals from multiple input sentences, which combines the benefits of attention and maxpooling.\nThe proposed method increases AUC by 10% (from 0.261 to 0.284), and outperforms recently published results on the FB-NYT dataset.\nEarly work in relation extraction from text used fully supervised methods, e.g., BID2 , which motivated the development of relatively small datasets with sentence-level annotations such as ACE 2004 BID2 , BioInfer and SemEval 2010 .\nRecognizing the difficulty of annotating text with relations, especially when the number of relation types of interest is large, BID16 pioneered the distant supervision approach to relation extraction, where a knowledge base (KB) and a text corpus are used to automatically generate a large dataset of labeled sentences which is then used to train a relation classifier.\nDistant supervision provides a practical alternative to manual annotations, but introduces many noisy examples.\nAlthough many methods have been proposed to reduce the noise in distantly supervised models for relation extraction (e.g., BID8 BID23 BID22 BID5 BID27 BID11 , a rather obvious approach has been understudied: using sentence-level supervision to augment distant supervision.\nIntuitively, supervision at the sentence-level can help reduce the noise in distantly supervised models by identifying which of the input sentences for a given pair of entities are likely to express a relation.We experiment with a variety of model architectures to combine sentence-and bag-level supervision and find it most effective to use the sentence-level annotations to directly supervise the sentence encoder component of the model in a multi-task learning framework.\nWe also introduce a novel maxpooling attention architecture for combining the evidence provided by different sentences where the entity pair is mentioned, and use the sentence-level annotations to supervise attention weights.The contributions of this paper are as follows:• We propose an effective multitask learning setup for reducing distant supervision noise by leveraging existing datasets of relations annotated at the sentence level.•\nWe propose maxpooled attention, a neural architecture which combines the benefits of maxpooling and soft attention, and show that it helps the model combine information about a pair of entities from multiple sentences.•\nWe release our library for relation extraction as open source. 1\nThe following section defines the notation we use, describes the problem and provides an overview of our approach.\nWe propose two complementary methods to improve performance and reduce noise in distantly supervised relation extraction.\nThe first is incorporating sentence-level supervision and the second is maxpooled attention, a novel form of attention.\nThe sentence-level supervision improves sentence encoding and provides supervision for attention weights, while maxpooled attention effectively combines sentence encodings and their weights into a bag encoding.\nOur experiments show a 10% improvement in AUC (from 0.261 to 0.284) outperforming recently published results on the FB-NYT dataset .\n\nSummary:  In your response, the letter a should appear 34 times.",

Oswald, Bugs, and hundreds of other characters were created by Walt Disney, perhaps the most famous cartoonist in history. Born in prefix = st1 /Chicagoin 1901, Walt Disney always wanted to be an artist. After returning from World War I, in which he drove an ambulance, Disney worked as a commercial artist. He enjoyed drawing cartoons more than anything else, and decided to try his hand at a technology that was new at the time, moving pictures. In the 1920's, he produced several films where he made cartoon characters move as if by magic. The technique Disney used was painstaking. He made hundreds or even thousands of repeated drawings of the same character. In each drawing, the character was changed just a bit. A film was taken of the series of drawings, and when it was shown, the characters appeared to move. The process, called animation, is still used today, although computers have made the process much easier. In 1928, Disney created his most famous character, Mortimer Mouse, who we know today as Mickey. The mouse starred in a cartoon called Steamboat Willie, which was unusual because it involved the use of a sound track. Within the next few years, Disney invented many of his other characters. The list of Disney's animation successes is long and memorable. It includes Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Peter Pan. Perhaps his most remarkable animated film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Created in 1937, it was an immediate success. Today, more than fifty years later, it is still one of the most popular films for children. Options: A More people like animated movies. B Fewer people like animated movies.

I used to listen to the stories my father would tell me about his stay in Canada and tours to Europe in the 1970s, with great interest. My big moment finally came in the summer of 1998 when I was able to accompany my parents to Europe, where my father was to attend a meeting. We planned to travel to Belgium, Netherlands and West Germany. I have clear memories even today of going to Mumbai airport at night all excited about finally going abroad. I had heard several great things about Lufthansa till then but now I finally got to experience them first hand, during the flight to Frankfurt. We flew business class and even today I can remember the excellent service by the Lufthansa crew  . The flight was really smooth and thoroughly enjoyable, even for someone like me, who is especially afraid of flying. After spending almost two weeks in Europe, we took the Lufthansa airport express from Dusseldorf to Frankfurt airport, for our return flight. What a journey that was! All along the Rhine  , it was simply an unforgettable experience. I had a sombre feeling on the flight back to Mumbai as it marked the end of a wonderful vacation, but the Lufthansa crew members were able to change it into a most enjoyable experience yet again, with the quality of their service. Being the first airline to take me abroad, Lufthansa will always hold a special place in my heart. Even today,I continue to enjoy flights on Lufthansa and simply cannot dream of choosing any other airline.

The demand has resulted in increased research about ethanol fuel. Ethanol is an alcohol that can be mixed with gas. It burns up most of the pollutants in gas. It replaces some of the chemicals that are known to cause cancer, and it can be produced in the United States. Some experts say that in the future ethanol will replace some of the oil imported into America. Today ethanol is less than one percent of total American fuel supply. The head of the National Corn Growers Association, Kieve Hard, says ethanol will provide twenty-five percent of the fuel supply by 2030. The organization is involved in the production of ethanol because it can be made from corn. One company in the American Midwest says it is starting to produce ethanol because of demands from people and from the government. The Congress approved the Clean Air Act in 1990. The company says this means the market for ethanol will expand. The company is a major producer of corn starch that can be used to make ethanol. At Texas A and M University Professor Mark Holzapple produces ethanol from materials found in solid waste. He has developed a way to turn materials like paper into simple sugar. He then uses yeast to turn the sugar into ethanol. Professor Holzapple says two hundred liters of ethanol fuel can be produced from one ton of solid waste. A professor at the University of Arkansas, John Geddie, is exploring another way to make ethanol. He is using acids on paper material. He says a large factory could produce ethanol from waste paper at a cost about the same as the cost of producing gasoline. Environmentalists support the use of ethanol because it turns solid waste into a useful product. Professor Holzapple says law makers in industrial nations need to support the development of this clean, less expensive fuel of the future. Options: A corn starch B natural gas C waste paper D solid waste Answer: B natural gas Question:\n\nA: The author mentions all of the following resources for making ethanol except  _  .\n\n\nProblem: Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A  rainfores is an area covered by tall trees with the total high rainfall spreading quite equally through the year and the temperature rarely dipping below 16degC.Rainforests have a great effect on the world environment because they can take in  heat from the sun and adjust  the climate. Without the forest cover, these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere,warming the rest of the world .Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns, potentially causing certain natural disasters  all over the world. In the past hundred years, humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources  : land for crops, wood for paper and other products, land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit . There are two main reasons for _ . Firstly, when people cut down trees, generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly, cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now, but in the long run  it actually reduces the world' s wood supply. Rainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests. However, fewer than 1% of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value. It is extremely likely that our best chance to cure diseases lies somewhere in  the world's shrinking rainforests. Options: A reflect  more heat into the atmosphere B bring about high rainfall throughout the world C rarely cause the temperature to drop lower than 16degC D reduce the effect of heat from the sun on the earth Answer: D reduce the effect of heat from the sun on the earth Question:\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n..Rainforests can help to adjust the climate because they  _  .\n\n\nQ: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Almost no young people today know who the cartoon character Oswald the Rabbit is, but they certainly recognize his successor, Bugs Bunny. Oswald, Bugs, and hundreds of other characters were created by Walt Disney, perhaps the most famous cartoonist in history. Born in prefix = st1 /Chicagoin 1901, Walt Disney always wanted to be an artist. After returning from World War I, in which he drove an ambulance, Disney worked as a commercial artist. He enjoyed drawing cartoons more than anything else, and decided to try his hand at a technology that was new at the time, moving pictures. In the 1920's, he produced several films where he made cartoon characters move as if by magic. The technique Disney used was painstaking. He made hundreds or even thousands of repeated drawings of the same character. In each drawing, the character was changed just a bit. A film was taken of the series of drawings, and when it was shown, the characters appeared to move. The process, called animation, is still used today, although computers have made the process much easier. In 1928, Disney created his most famous character, Mortimer Mouse, who we know today as Mickey. The mouse starred in a cartoon called Steamboat Willie, which was unusual because it involved the use of a sound track. Within the next few years, Disney invented many of his other characters. The list of Disney's animation successes is long and memorable. It includes Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Peter Pan. Perhaps his most remarkable animated film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Created in 1937, it was an immediate success. Today, more than fifty years later, it is still one of the most popular films for children. Options: A More people like animated movies. B Fewer people like animated movies. C Computers have made the job easier. D Computers have made the job harder. Answer: C Computers have made the job easier. Question:\nA: Answer with around 22 words",

Generally, the requirements for state licensure and state certification include having a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition or a related area, supervised practice, and passing an exam. If you’re curious, the 4 states that currently do not have any licensure requirements are Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and New Jersey. The accreditation required for a degree in the nutritional science field varies from state to state. Currently, 46 states require an accredited 2 or 4 year degree in nutritional science (either online or campus-based.) Getting your bachelor’s in nutrition, institution management, biology, chemistry, and physiology is your best bet. You’ll also benefit from business, mathematics, psychology, sociology, and economics courses. Odds are, if your program is a good one, it will touch on all these bases. And if your state is one that requires a license with experience, it’s best to pick a program that has a built in internship. An advanced degree isn’t strictly necessary, but a solid understanding of biology, chemistry and health will be a great asset. In addition, the more education you have, the more job opportunities you’ll have. If you’d like to continue learning, it's a good idea! If you do complete an advanced degree, you are that much closer to getting certified through the CBNS (Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists). If you take and pass the exam, you will become a Certified Nutrition Specialist. However, this article will outline becoming a Certified Clinical Nutritionist -- a process that doesn’t need an advanced degree.",

Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum. The word is from the Greek κρυπτός, kryptos, meaning hidden ὄρχις, orchis, meaning testicle. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital. About 3 % of full-term and 30 % of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80 % of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1 % overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.\n\nAnswer this question: failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum at birth?\nCoT: The relevant information is: Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum.\n\n\nAns: Beijing and towns in the neighboring Hebei province , People 's Republic of China",

Traditional security systems are no longer sufficient, as cyber criminals are constantly developing new attack techniques that can easily bypass them. Therefore, an AI-powered security system is required that can adapt to these new threats and provide comprehensive protection to enterprise applications.\r\n\r\n\\section{AI-Powered Security System}\r\n\r\nThe proposed AI-powered security system utilizes machine learning algorithms that can identify and block potential cyber threats in real-time. These algorithms are capable of self-adapting to new attack techniques, ensuring that the security system remains effective even against the latest threats.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the security system provides granular access control to all users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. All data transmissions within the enterprise application are monitored and logged, allowing for easy identification of any suspicious activities.\r\n\r\n\\section{User Activity Monitoring}\r\n\r\nThe security system also provides complete audit logs of all user activities, allowing for easy identification of any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. This feature is essential for compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, as it provides a comprehensive record of all user activities.\r\n\r\n\\section{Contingency Plans}\r\n\r\nIn the event of a security breach, the system has contingency plans in place to handle the situation. These plans include isolating affected systems, blocking access to sensitive data, and notifying relevant personnel.\r\n\r\n\\section{Conclusion}\r\n\r\nAn AI-powered security system is essential for any organization that wants to protect its enterprise applications from cyber threats. With its ability to adapt to new attack techniques, provide granular access control, and monitor all user activities, this system provides comprehensive protection to sensitive data. Furthermore, its contingency plans ensure that any security breaches are handled effectively and efficiently.",

Traditional security systems are no longer sufficient, as cyber criminals are constantly developing new attack techniques that can easily bypass them. Therefore, an AI-powered security system is required that can adapt to these new threats and provide comprehensive protection to enterprise applications.\r\n\r\n\\section{AI-Powered Security System}\r\n\r\nThe proposed AI-powered security system utilizes machine learning algorithms that can identify and block potential cyber threats in real-time. These algorithms are capable of self-adapting to new attack techniques, ensuring that the security system remains effective even against the latest threats.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the security system provides granular access control to all users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. All data transmissions within the enterprise application are monitored and logged, allowing for easy identification of any suspicious activities.\r\n\r\n\\section{User Activity Monitoring}\r\n\r\nThe security system also provides complete audit logs of all user activities, allowing for easy identification of any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. This feature is essential for compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, as it provides a comprehensive record of all user activities.\r\n\r\n\\section{Contingency Plans}\r\n\r\nIn the event of a security breach, the system has contingency plans in place to handle the situation. These plans include isolating affected systems, blocking access to sensitive data, and notifying relevant personnel.\r\n\r\n\\section{Conclusion}\r\n\r\nAn AI-powered security system is essential for any organization that wants to protect its enterprise applications from cyber threats. With its ability to adapt to new attack techniques, provide granular access control, and monitor all user activities, this system provides comprehensive protection to sensitive data. Furthermore, its contingency plans ensure that any security breaches are handled effectively and efficiently.",

This is not your turn to talk; you don’t want to miss a great idea because you are filling the time.\nC) Thank those for offering suggestions. Each one gets you closer to a solution.\n\nStep #4: Takeaways\nIn this step, you will state your takeaways. This is a very important step to prevent overwhelm. This often takes the full 5 minutes to ensure these are specific and actionable.\nIf you are on the hot seat:\nA) Be prepared to share your top takeaway.\nB) Stay coachable as we help you make it specific and actionable.\nC) Share your takeaways with your coach immediately after the session.\n\nBonus: Have fun!\nRemember to have fun and enjoy the experience! Hot seating can be an excellent opportunity for personal and professional growth, and embracing the opportunity to learn and grow is essential.",

Tentacle???\noutput answer: The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters - Sarah Sullivan (Sarah Lieving) and Erin Lynch (Erin Sullivan) - have arrived from the United States to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage(possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise.As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005, but the tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries, but has since been awakened by mankind, and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground, with the filmmakers documenting the catastrophe as it unfolds.It starts as Sarah and Erin are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Sarah's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Erin films Sarah talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building trying to find someone who can speak English. Eventually, they find Justin - a worker - who is from America as well. He says that they have to go to the American embassy, and, as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel.Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged.

Her dad agrees to send only two agents with Anna and Gabrielle La Clare (Beatrice Rosen) to a concert when Anna goes to Prague with her parents. A sexy new look for Anna causes her father to renege. When Anna discovers the concert is filled with agents and that her father has broken his promise, Gabrielle helps Anna elude her protectors. Outside the concert, Anna meets Ben Calder (Matthew Goode), and asks him to drive her to escape the agents. Anna goes to a bar with Ben and proceeds to get drunk. Unbeknownst to Anna, Ben is with the Secret Service, and tells agents Alan Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Cynthia Morales (Annabella Sciorra) where Anna is. The President orders the three agents to have Ben guard Anna without telling her who he really is, to give her an illusion of freedom with a guarantee of safety. Believing herself free of her guards for the first time in years, Anna jumps into the Vltava River naked, mistaking it for the Danube, and Ben has to fish her out (he stays clothed). Weiss and Morales buy the camera from someone taking pictures of the skinny-dipping Anna. Anna and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an opera being shown in a plaza, where Anna eventually falls asleep with Ben guarding her, and Weiss and Morales watching from another roof.The next morning, Anna calls her parents to avoid getting into further trouble with them.

        "user_prompt": "input question: Question: \"vapor is responsible for?\"  Context: \"A very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening. Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\"  Answer:???\noutput answer: lamp darkening\nQuestion: \"Where is the major cemetary?\"  Context: \"The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, José Batlle y Ordóñez, Juan Manuel Blanes, François Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, José Enrique Rodó, and Juan Zorrilla de San Martín.\"  Answer:\n----\nAnswer: Barrio Sur\nQ: Question: \"What other types of climate measuring devices are there\"  Context: \"The climate of Cork, like the rest of Ireland, is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b. Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city. It should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill.\"  Answer:\nA: synoptic\nQuestion: Question: \"in what sense do these elevators have low capacity?\"  Context: \"A elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. a diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\" if there's a sudden increase in pressure avove the cab. however, to go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurize the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. this also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. the \"shaft\" is made of acrilic, is always round, due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. in order to keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity. they usually allow 1-3 passengers and up to 525 lbs.\"  Answer:\nAnswer: they usually allow 1-3 passengers and up to 525 lbs\n[Q]: Question: \"How did large factories strengthen their work base?\"  Context: \"Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.\"  Answer:\n****\n[A]: high schools were created\nProblem: Given the question: Question: \"Besides Russia, what country is not part of the G7?\"  Context: \"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\"  Answer:\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:",

Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening. Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\"  Answer:???\noutput answer: lamp darkening\nQuestion: \"Where is the major cemetary?\"  Context: \"The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, José Batlle y Ordóñez, Juan Manuel Blanes, François Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, José Enrique Rodó, and Juan Zorrilla de San Martín.\"  Answer:\n----\nAnswer: Barrio Sur\nQ: Question: \"What other types of climate measuring devices are there\"  Context: \"The climate of Cork, like the rest of Ireland, is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b. Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city. It should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill.\"  Answer:\nA: synoptic\nQuestion: Question: \"in what sense do these elevators have low capacity?\"  Context: \"A elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. a diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\" if there's a sudden increase in pressure avove the cab. however, to go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurize the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. this also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. the \"shaft\" is made of acrilic, is always round, due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. in order to keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity. they usually allow 1-3 passengers and up to 525 lbs.\"  Answer:\nAnswer: they usually allow 1-3 passengers and up to 525 lbs\n[Q]: Question: \"How did large factories strengthen their work base?\"  Context: \"Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.\"  Answer:\n****\n[A]: high schools were created\nProblem: Given the question: Question: \"Besides Russia, what country is not part of the G7?\"  Context: \"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\"  Answer:\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:",

In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat. Singh fell back to Gauhati but was defeated by Gen. Maha Thilawa on 3 June 1822. The fallen king fled to the British territory, and continued to make raids in the years leading to the First Anglo-Burmese War.\n\nHow many years spanned these events?\nA: 5\n\nTrying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Raiders flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 12 AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. In the first quarter, Oakland took the early lead as kicker Sebastian Janikowski managed to get a 25-yard field goal. However, the Chiefs took the lead with RB Kolby Smith getting a 10-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Raiders drew closer as Janikowski kicked a 54-yard field goal. However, Kansas City managed to get one last strike prior to halftime as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland regained the lead with RB LaMont Jordan getting a 5-yard TD run.  However, the Chiefs retook the lead with Smith getting a 5-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders once again jumped into the lead as RB Justin Fargas got a 14-yard TD run.  This time, the defense managed to hold on for the win. With the win, not only did the Raiders improve to 3-8, but they managed to do four things with their one win. First, they snapped their six-game losing skid. Second, they snapped a nine-game losing skid to the Chiefs. Third, they snapped a 17-game losing streak against divisional opponents with their first divisional win since 2004. And finally, they surpassed their regular season win total from last season.\n\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?\nA: 54-yard\n\nHoping to snap a four-game losing streak, the Bills flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 12 duel with the Kansas City Chiefs.  In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Chiefs QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 36-yard TD pass to RB Jamaal Charles.  The Bills responded with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

One of the main features of end-to-end systems, in addition to the ability to free themselves from extra linguistic resources such as dictionaries or language models, is the capacity to model acoustic units such as characters, subwords or directly words; opening up the capacity to directly translate speech with different representations or levels of knowledge depending on the target language. In this paper we propose a review of the existing end-to-end ASR approaches for the French language. We compare results to conventional state-of-the-art ASR systems and discuss which units are more suited to model the French language.\n\nIntroduction\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has traditionally used Hidden Markov Models (HMM), describing temporal variability, combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), computing emission probabilities from HMM states, to model and map acoustic features to phones. In recent years, the introduction of deep neural networks replacing GMM for acoustic modeling showed huge improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art systems BIBREF0, BIBREF1. However, building and training such systems can be complex and a lot of preprocessing steps are involved. Traditional ASR systems are also factorized in several modules, the acoustic model representing only one of them along with lexicon and language models.\nRecently, more direct approaches – called end-to-end methods – in which neural architectures are trained to directly model sequences of features as characters have been proposed BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4. Predicting context independent targets such as characters using a single neural network architecture, drained a lot of interest from the research community as well as non-experts developers. This is caused by the simplicity of the pipeline and the possibility to create a complete ASR system without the need for expert knowledge. Moreover having an orthographic-based output allows to freely construct words, making it interesting against the Out-Of-Vocabulary problem encountered in traditional ASR systems.\nEnd-to-end systems are nowadays extensively used and studied for multiple tasks and languages such as English, Mandarin or Japanese. However, for a language such as French, ASR performance and results with the existing methods have been scarcely studied, although the large number of silents letters, homophones or argot make comparing the assumptions made by each method very attractive.\nIn this context, we decided to study the three main types of architectures which have demonstrated promising results over traditional systems: 1) Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) BIBREF5, BIBREF6 which uses Markov assumptions (i.e. conditional independence between predictions at each time step) to efficiently solve sequential problems by dynamic programming, 2) Attention-based methods BIBREF7, BIBREF8 which rely on an attention mechanism to perform non-monotonic alignment between acoustic frames and recognized acoustic units and 3) RNN-tranducer BIBREF0, BIBREF9, BIBREF10 which extends CTC by additionally modeling the dependencies between outputs at different steps using a prediction network analogous to a language model. We extend our experiments by adding two hybrid end-to-end methods: a multi-task method called joint CTC-attention BIBREF11, BIBREF12 and a RNN-transducer extended with attention mechanisms BIBREF13. To complete our review, we build a state-of-art phone-based system based on lattice-free MMI criterion BIBREF14 and its end-to-end counterpart with both phonetic and orthographic units BIBREF15.\n\nImplementations\nAll our systems share equivalent optimization – no rescoring technique or post-processing is done – as well as equivalent resource usage. Each system is kept to its initial form (i.e. no further training on top of the reported system).\n\nImplementations ::: Acoustic units\nFor our experiments, three kind of acoustic units were chosen: phones, characters and subwords. The baseline phone-based systems use the standard 36 phones used in French. The CTC, attention and hybrid systems each have two versions: one for characters with 41 classes (26 letters from the Latin alphabet, 14 letters with a diacritic and apostrophe) and another version for subwords where the number of classes is set to 500, the final set of subword units used in our training being selected by using a subword segmentation algorithm based on a unigram language model BIBREF21 and implemented in Google's toolkit SentencePiece BIBREF22. For the end-to-end variant of the chain model, characters units are used with the 41 classes set.\n\nResults\nThe results of our experiments in terms of Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) on the test set are gathered in the Table TABREF12. For CER we also report errors in the metric: correct, substituted, inserted and deleted characters.\nIt should be noted that the default CER computation in all frameworks does not use a special character for space during scoring. As important information relative to this character, denoting word-boundary errors, can be observed through the WER variation during comparison, we kept the initial computation for CER. Thus, for low CER variations, bigger WER differences are expected notably between traditional and end-to-end systems.\n\nResults ::: Baseline systems\nThe phone-based chain model trained with lattice-free MMI criterion has a WER of 14.2 on the test set. Compared to the best reported system during the ESTER campaign (WER 12.1% BIBREF16), the performance show a relative degradation of 14.8%. Although the compared system rely on a HMM-GMM architecture, it should be noted that a triple-pass rescoring (+ post-processing) is applied, a consequent number of parameters is used, and a substantial amount of data is used for training the language model (more than 11 times our volume). Adding i-vectors features the performance of our model is further improved, leading to a WER of 13.7.\nFor the end-to-end phone-based system we denote a small WER degradation of 0.2% compared to the original system without i-vectors, which is a good trade-off considering the removal of the initial HMM-GMM training. Switching to characters as acoustic units we obtain a WER of 14.8, corresponding to a CER of 7.6. The detailed report show that all types of errors are quite balanced, with however a higher number of deletions. The system remains competitive even with orthographic units, despite the low correspondence between phonemes and letters in French. On the same note, a plain conversion of phonetic lexicon to a grapheme-based one does not negatively impact the performances. This was not excepted considering the use of alternative phonetic representation in French to denotes possible liaisons (the pronunciation of the final consonant of a word immediately before a following vowel sound in preceding word).\n\nQuestion: What are the existing end-to-end ASR approaches for the French language?",

The recent discovery of 'non-visual' retinal receptors has confirmed an anatomical basis for the non-image forming, biological effects of light and has stimulated interest in the use of light to enhance wellbeing in the corporate setting.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective controlled intervention study was conducted within a shift-working call centre to investigate the effect of newly developed fluorescent light sources with a high correlated colour temperature (17000 K) upon the wellbeing, functioning and work performance of employees. Five items of the SF-36 questionnaire and a modification of the Columbia Jet Lag scale, were used to evaluate employees on two different floors of the call centre between February and May 2005. Questionnaire completion occurred at baseline and after a three month intervention period, during which time one floor was exposed to new high correlated colour temperature lighting and the other remained exposed to usual office lighting. Two sided t-tests with Bonferroni correction for type I errors were used to compare the characteristics of the two groups at baseline and to evaluate changes in the intervention and control groups over the period of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Individuals in the intervention arm of the study showed a significant improvement in self-reported ability to concentrate at study end as compared to those within the control arm (p < 0.05). The mean individual score on a 5 point Likert scale improved by 36.8% in the intervention group, compared with only 1.7% in the control group. The majority of this improvement occurred within the first 7 weeks of the 14 week study. Substantial within group improvements were observed in the intervention group in the areas of fatigue (26.9%), alertness (28.2%), daytime sleepiness (31%) and work performance (19.4%), as assessed by the modified Columbia Scale, and in the areas of vitality (28.4%) and mental health (13.9%), as assessed by the SF-36 over the study period.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: High correlated colour temperature fluorescent lights could provide a useful intervention to improve wellbeing and productivity in the corporate setting, although further work is necessary in quantifying the magnitude of likely benefits.",

For example, given {apple(noun), tree(noun), pick(verb)}, humans can easily come up with scenes like \"a boy is picking an apple from a tree\" via their generative commonsense reasoning ability. However, we find this capacity has not been well learned by machines. Most prior works in machine commonsense focus on discriminative reasoning tasks with a multi-choice question answering setting. Herein, we present CommonGen: a challenging dataset for testing generative commonsense reasoning with a constrained text generation task. We collect 37k concept-sets as inputs and 90k human-written sentences as associated outputs. Additionally, we also provide high-quality rationales behind the reasoning process for the development and test sets from the human annotators. We demonstrate the difficulty of the task by examining a wide range of sequence generation methods with both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

It is an ability of combining commonsense facts and logic rules to make new presumptions about ordinary scenes in our daily life. A distinct property of commonsense reasoning problems is that they are generally trivial for human-beings while challenging for machine reasoners.\nThere have been a few recent tasks and datasets for testing machine commonsense, while most of them frame their problems as multi-choice question answering, such as CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1. We name this kind of tasks as deterministic commonsense reasoning because they focus on modeling the plausibility of given complete scenes. The systems for these tasks thus have to work with biased selection of distractors, and thus are less practical or challenging. Simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF2. On the other hand, few work has been done so far in testing machine commonsense in a generative reasoning setting, where a reasoner is expected to complete scenes with several given concepts.\nSpecifically, we would like to investigate if machine-reasoning models can generate a sentence that contains a required set of concepts (i.e. nouns or verbs) while describing a common scene in our daily life. For example, as shown in Figure FIGREF1, given an unordered collection of concepts “{apple (noun), bag (noun), pick (verb), place (verb), tree (noun)}”, a rational reasoner should be able to generate a sentence like “A boy picks some apples from a tree and places them into a bag.”, which describes a natural scene and contains all given concepts. The creation of this sentence is easy for humans while non-trivial for even state-of-the-art conditional language generation models. We argue that such an ability of recovering natural scenes of daily life can benefit a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks including image/video captioning BIBREF3, BIBREF4, scene-based visual reasoning and VQA BIBREF5, storytelling BIBREF6, and dialogue systems BIBREF7, BIBREF8.\nTowards empowering machines with the generative commonsense reasoning ability, we create a large-scale dataset, named CommonGen, for the constrained text generation task. We collect $37,263$ concept-sets as the inputs, each of which contains three to five common concepts. These concept-sets are sampled from several large corpora of image/video captions, such that the concepts inside them are more likely to co-occur in natural scenes. Through crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we finally obtain $89,028$ human-written sentences as expected outputs. We investigate the performance of sophisticated sequence generation methods for the proposed task with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The experiments show that all methods are far from human performance in generative commonsense reasoning. Our main contributions are as follows: 1) We introduce the first large-scale constrained text generation dataset targeting at generative commonsense reasoning; 2) We systematically compare methods for this (lexically) constrained text generation with extensive experiments and evaluation. 3) Our code and data are publicly available (w/ the URL in the abstract), so future research in this direction can be directly developed in a unified framework.\n\nProblem Formulation\nIn this section, we formulate our task with mathematical notations and discuss its inherent challenges. The input to the task is a set of $n$ concepts $x=\\lbrace c_1,c_2,\\dots ,c_n\\rbrace \\in \\mathcal {X}$, where $c_i\\in \\mathcal {C}$ is a common noun or verb. $\\mathcal {X}$ denotes the space of concept-sets and $\\mathcal {C}$ stands for the concept vocabulary. The expected output of this task is a simple, grammatical sentence $y\\in \\mathcal {Y}$, describing a natural scene in our daily-life that covers all given concepts in $x$. Note that other forms of given concepts are also accepted, such as plural forms of nouns and verbs. In addition, we also provide rationales as an optional resource to model the generation process. For each pair of $(x, y)$, a rationale $r$ is a list of sentences that explains the background commonsense knowledge used in the scene recovering process.\nThe task is to learn a structured predictive function $f:\\mathcal {X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal {Y}$, which maps a concept-set to a sentence. Thus, it can be seen as a special case of constrained text generation BIBREF9. The unique challenges of our proposed task come from two main aspects as follows.\nConstrained Decoding. Lexically constrained decoding for sentence generation has been an important and challenging research topic in machine translation community BIBREF10, where they focus on how to decode sentences when some words/phrases (e.g. terminology) must present in target sentences (Section SECREF6). However, it is still an open problem how to efficiently generate sentences given an unordered set of multiple keywords with potential morphological changes (e.g. “pick” $\\rightarrow $ “picks” in the previous case). Apart from that, the part-of-speech constraints brings even more difficulties (e.g. “place” can be verb/noun).\nCommonsense Reasoning. Apart from the challenge in constrained decoding, a generative commonsense reasoner also has to compositionally use (latent) commonsense knowledge for generating most plausible scenes. Recall the illustrative example in Figure FIGREF1, even such a simple scene generation process needs pretty much commonsense knowledge like: 1) “apples grow in trees”; 2) “bags are containers that you can put something in”; 3) “you usually pick something and then place it in a container”. Expected reasoners have to prioritize target scenes over an infinity number of less plausible scenes like “A boy picks an apple tree and places it into bags.” or “A boy places some bags on a tree and picks an apple.”.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Crowd-Sourcing via AMT\nIt is true that the above-mentioned associated caption sentences for each concept-set are human-written and do describe scenes that cover all given concepts. However, they are created under specific contexts (i.e. an image or a video) and thus might be less representative for common sense. To better measure the quality and interpretability of generative reasoners, we need to evaluate them with scenes and rationales created by using concept-sets only as the signals for annotators.\nWe collect more human-written scenes for each concept-set in dev and test set through crowd-sourcing via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Each input concept-set is annotated by at least three different humans. The annotators are also required to give sentences as the rationales, which further encourage them to use common sense in creating their scenes. The crowd-sourced sentences correlate well with the associated captions, meaning that it is reasonable to use caption sentences as training data although they can be partly noisy. Additionally, we utilize a search engine over the OMCS corpus BIBREF16 for retrieving relevant propositions as distant rationales in training data.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Statistics\nWe present the statistical information of our final dataset. Firstly, we summarize the basic statistics in Table TABREF9, such as the number of unique concept-sets, scene sentences, and sentence lengths. In total, there are 3,706 unique concepts among all concept-sets, and 3,614/1,018/1,207 in the train/dev/test parts respectively. Note that there are 4% of the dev and 6% of the test concepts never appear in the training data, so we can better understand how well trained models can perform with unseen concepts.\nWe analyze the overlap between training concept-sets and dev/test concept-sets. By average, we find that 98.8% of the training instances share no common concept at all with dev/test data, such that the dev/test can help us analyze model performance on new combinations of concepts.\nWe also visualize the frequency distribution of our test concept-sets in Figure FIGREF7 by showing the frequency of top 50 single concepts and co-occurred concept pairs.\n\nMethods ::: Other methods\nBased on the similarity between our task and abstractive summarization and story generation (with given topic words), we also apply Pointer Generator Networks (“PointerGen”) BIBREF26 and Multi-scale Fusion Attention (“Fusion Attn.”) BIBREF27 model respectively for our task.\n\nEvaluation ::: Setup\nWe use the proposed CommonGen dataset in two setting: knowledge-agnostic and knowledge-aware. For the knowledge-agnostic setting, we simply apply the methods in Section SECREF4 while we concatenate rationales and input concept-sets together as the knowledge-aware inputs (“$+r$”).\n\nEvaluation ::: Automatic Metrics\nFor automatically evaluating our methods, we propose to use widely used metric for image/video captioning. This is because the proposed CommonGen task can be regarded as also a caption task where the context are incomplete scenes with given concept-sets. Therefore, we choose BLEU-3/4 BIBREF28, ROUGE-2/L BIBREF29, CIDEr BIBREF30, and SPICE BIBREF31 as the main metrics. Apart from these classic metrics, we also include a novel embedding-based metric named BERTScore BIBREF32. To make the comparisons more clear, we show the delta of BERTScore results by subtracting the score of merely using input concept-sets as target sentences, named $\\triangle $BERTS.\nTo have an estimation about human performance in each metric, we iteratively treat every reference sentence in dev/test data as the prediction to be compared with all references (including itself). That is, if a model has the same reasoning ability with average performance of our crowd workers, its results should exceed this “human bound”.\n\nEvaluation ::: Experimental Results\nWe present the experimental results of five groups of methods that are introduced in Section SECREF4. We find that the model UniLM outperforms all other baseline methods by a large margin, which is expected due to it is pre-trained with the BERT encoder towards generation objectives. However, its performance is still way far from the human bound, and this margin is even larger in test data.\nWe notice that the most recent edit-based model named LevenTrans archives the best performance among models without pre-training at all. This shows that edit-based sequence generation models can better deal with the cases where target sentences share similar vocabulary with source ones. Nonetheless, the other two models within the same sequence modeling framework (i.e. fairseq) are much worse, which might because of their specialty designed for machine translation.\nAn order-insensitive sequence/set encoder, “mean encoder”, outperform order-sensitive counterparts like “bRNN”. However, such a marginal improvement is not seen in the comparison between “Trans.” vs “Trans. w/o Pos”. We assume that for short sequences the order sensitivity does not harm sequential encoders, while positional embeddings in Transformers can better improve the self-attention mechanism. Also, we find that Transformer-based seq2seq architectures are not outperforming simpler models like bRNN.\nAs for the use of additional retrieved sentences form OMCS corpus and human-written associated rationales, we find that they are not generally helpful in investigated architectures. Although they increase the BLEU and ROUGE scores, the metrics specially designed for captioning like CIDEr and SPICE are dropping down. We argue that it might because the OMCS sentences are actually not aligned with training data, and more sophisticated methods for encoding such non-sequential facts in a more compositional way.\n\nEvaluation ::: Qualitative Analysis\nFor more clearly observe the performance of interested models, we present several real system outputs on the test set in Table TABREF24. We find that models usually cannot cover all given concepts, and also can produce repetitions of given concepts (e.g. “a dog catches a dog”, “a couple of couples”, and “at an object and an object .”). Moreover, we find that the order of actions may be mot natural. For example, the model output “a man pulls a sword out of his mouth and swallows it” makes less sense because a man usually swallow a sword first before he pull it out in such performances.\n\nRelated Work ::: Machine Common Sense\nMachine common sense (MCS) has long been considered as one of the most significant area in artificial intelligence. Recently, there are various emerging datasets for testing machine commonsense from different angles, such as commonsense extraction BIBREF33, BIBREF34, next situation prediction (SWAG BIBREF1, CODAH BIBREF35, HellaSWAG BIBREF36), cultural/social understanding BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39, visual scene comprehension BIBREF40, and general commonsense question answering BIBREF0, BIBREF41. Most of them are in a multi-choice QA setting for discriminative commonsense reasoning, among which CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1 are two typical examples. The input of the CSQA task is a question that needs commonsense reasoning and there are five candidate answers (words/phrases). The SWAG task asks models to select which situation is the most plausible next situation, given a sentence describing an event.\nThe two tasks share very similar objectives with large pre-trained language encoders like BERT BIBREF42: Masked-LM can predict the missing words in an incomplete sentence, which is similar to the CSQA setting; NextSentPrediction classifies whether a sentence is the next sentence of the given sentence in the corpora, which can be seen as using distant supervision for the SWAG task. Thus, simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF43, BIBREF2, but it does not necessarily mean machine reasoners can really produce new assumptions in an open and generative setting. The proposed CommonGen, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dataset and task for generative commonsense reasoning.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we purpose a novel constrained text generation task for generative commonsense reasoning. We introduce a new large-scale dataset named CommonGen and investigate various methods on them. Through our extensive experiments and human evaluation, we demonstrate that the inherent difficulties of the new task cannot be addressed by even the state-of-the-art pre-trained language generation model.\nFor the future research, we believe the following directions are highly valuable to explore: 1) specially designed metrics for automatic evaluation that focus on commonsense plausibility; 2) better mechanisms for retrieving and imposing useful commonsense knowledge into sentence generation processes; 3) explicitly modeling keyword-centric edits (e.g. insertion, deletion, morphological changes) such that relevant commonsense knowledge can be well utilized. We also believe that models performed well on CommonGen can be easily transferred to other commonsense-required reasoning tasks with few annotations, including image/video captioning, visual question answering, and discriminative multi-choice commonsense question answering.\n\nFigure 1: A motivating example for generative commonsense reasoning and the COMMONGEN task.

For example, given {apple(noun), tree(noun), pick(verb)}, humans can easily come up with scenes like \"a boy is picking an apple from a tree\" via their generative commonsense reasoning ability. However, we find this capacity has not been well learned by machines. Most prior works in machine commonsense focus on discriminative reasoning tasks with a multi-choice question answering setting. Herein, we present CommonGen: a challenging dataset for testing generative commonsense reasoning with a constrained text generation task. We collect 37k concept-sets as inputs and 90k human-written sentences as associated outputs. Additionally, we also provide high-quality rationales behind the reasoning process for the development and test sets from the human annotators. We demonstrate the difficulty of the task by examining a wide range of sequence generation methods with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The state-of-the-art pre-trained generation model, UniLM, is still far from human performance in this task. Our data and code is publicly available at this http URL .\n\nIntroduction\nCommonsense reasoning has long been acknowledged as a critical bottleneck of artificial intelligence and especially in natural language processing. It is an ability of combining commonsense facts and logic rules to make new presumptions about ordinary scenes in our daily life. A distinct property of commonsense reasoning problems is that they are generally trivial for human-beings while challenging for machine reasoners.\nThere have been a few recent tasks and datasets for testing machine commonsense, while most of them frame their problems as multi-choice question answering, such as CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1. We name this kind of tasks as deterministic commonsense reasoning because they focus on modeling the plausibility of given complete scenes. The systems for these tasks thus have to work with biased selection of distractors, and thus are less practical or challenging. Simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF2. On the other hand, few work has been done so far in testing machine commonsense in a generative reasoning setting, where a reasoner is expected to complete scenes with several given concepts.\nSpecifically, we would like to investigate if machine-reasoning models can generate a sentence that contains a required set of concepts (i.e. nouns or verbs) while describing a common scene in our daily life. For example, as shown in Figure FIGREF1, given an unordered collection of concepts “{apple (noun), bag (noun), pick (verb), place (verb), tree (noun)}”, a rational reasoner should be able to generate a sentence like “A boy picks some apples from a tree and places them into a bag.”, which describes a natural scene and contains all given concepts. The creation of this sentence is easy for humans while non-trivial for even state-of-the-art conditional language generation models. We argue that such an ability of recovering natural scenes of daily life can benefit a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks including image/video captioning BIBREF3, BIBREF4, scene-based visual reasoning and VQA BIBREF5, storytelling BIBREF6, and dialogue systems BIBREF7, BIBREF8.\nTowards empowering machines with the generative commonsense reasoning ability, we create a large-scale dataset, named CommonGen, for the constrained text generation task. We collect $37,263$ concept-sets as the inputs, each of which contains three to five common concepts. These concept-sets are sampled from several large corpora of image/video captions, such that the concepts inside them are more likely to co-occur in natural scenes. Through crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we finally obtain $89,028$ human-written sentences as expected outputs. We investigate the performance of sophisticated sequence generation methods for the proposed task with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The experiments show that all methods are far from human performance in generative commonsense reasoning. Our main contributions are as follows: 1) We introduce the first large-scale constrained text generation dataset targeting at generative commonsense reasoning; 2) We systematically compare methods for this (lexically) constrained text generation with extensive experiments and evaluation. 3) Our code and data are publicly available (w/ the URL in the abstract), so future research in this direction can be directly developed in a unified framework.\n\nProblem Formulation\nIn this section, we formulate our task with mathematical notations and discuss its inherent challenges. The input to the task is a set of $n$ concepts $x=\\lbrace c_1,c_2,\\dots ,c_n\\rbrace \\in \\mathcal {X}$, where $c_i\\in \\mathcal {C}$ is a common noun or verb. $\\mathcal {X}$ denotes the space of concept-sets and $\\mathcal {C}$ stands for the concept vocabulary. The expected output of this task is a simple, grammatical sentence $y\\in \\mathcal {Y}$, describing a natural scene in our daily-life that covers all given concepts in $x$. Note that other forms of given concepts are also accepted, such as plural forms of nouns and verbs. In addition, we also provide rationales as an optional resource to model the generation process. For each pair of $(x, y)$, a rationale $r$ is a list of sentences that explains the background commonsense knowledge used in the scene recovering process.\nThe task is to learn a structured predictive function $f:\\mathcal {X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal {Y}$, which maps a concept-set to a sentence. Thus, it can be seen as a special case of constrained text generation BIBREF9. The unique challenges of our proposed task come from two main aspects as follows.\nConstrained Decoding. Lexically constrained decoding for sentence generation has been an important and challenging research topic in machine translation community BIBREF10, where they focus on how to decode sentences when some words/phrases (e.g. terminology) must present in target sentences (Section SECREF6). However, it is still an open problem how to efficiently generate sentences given an unordered set of multiple keywords with potential morphological changes (e.g. “pick” $\\rightarrow $ “picks” in the previous case). Apart from that, the part-of-speech constraints brings even more difficulties (e.g. “place” can be verb/noun).\nCommonsense Reasoning. Apart from the challenge in constrained decoding, a generative commonsense reasoner also has to compositionally use (latent) commonsense knowledge for generating most plausible scenes. Recall the illustrative example in Figure FIGREF1, even such a simple scene generation process needs pretty much commonsense knowledge like: 1) “apples grow in trees”; 2) “bags are containers that you can put something in”; 3) “you usually pick something and then place it in a container”. Expected reasoners have to prioritize target scenes over an infinity number of less plausible scenes like “A boy picks an apple tree and places it into bags.” or “A boy places some bags on a tree and picks an apple.”.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Crowd-Sourcing via AMT\nIt is true that the above-mentioned associated caption sentences for each concept-set are human-written and do describe scenes that cover all given concepts. However, they are created under specific contexts (i.e. an image or a video) and thus might be less representative for common sense. To better measure the quality and interpretability of generative reasoners, we need to evaluate them with scenes and rationales created by using concept-sets only as the signals for annotators.\nWe collect more human-written scenes for each concept-set in dev and test set through crowd-sourcing via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Each input concept-set is annotated by at least three different humans. The annotators are also required to give sentences as the rationales, which further encourage them to use common sense in creating their scenes. The crowd-sourced sentences correlate well with the associated captions, meaning that it is reasonable to use caption sentences as training data although they can be partly noisy. Additionally, we utilize a search engine over the OMCS corpus BIBREF16 for retrieving relevant propositions as distant rationales in training data.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Statistics\nWe present the statistical information of our final dataset. Firstly, we summarize the basic statistics in Table TABREF9, such as the number of unique concept-sets, scene sentences, and sentence lengths. In total, there are 3,706 unique concepts among all concept-sets, and 3,614/1,018/1,207 in the train/dev/test parts respectively. Note that there are 4% of the dev and 6% of the test concepts never appear in the training data, so we can better understand how well trained models can perform with unseen concepts.\nWe analyze the overlap between training concept-sets and dev/test concept-sets. By average, we find that 98.8% of the training instances share no common concept at all with dev/test data, such that the dev/test can help us analyze model performance on new combinations of concepts.\nWe also visualize the frequency distribution of our test concept-sets in Figure FIGREF7 by showing the frequency of top 50 single concepts and co-occurred concept pairs.\n\nMethods ::: Other methods\nBased on the similarity between our task and abstractive summarization and story generation (with given topic words), we also apply Pointer Generator Networks (“PointerGen”) BIBREF26 and Multi-scale Fusion Attention (“Fusion Attn.”) BIBREF27 model respectively for our task.\n\nEvaluation ::: Setup\nWe use the proposed CommonGen dataset in two setting: knowledge-agnostic and knowledge-aware. For the knowledge-agnostic setting, we simply apply the methods in Section SECREF4 while we concatenate rationales and input concept-sets together as the knowledge-aware inputs (“$+r$”).\n\nEvaluation ::: Automatic Metrics\nFor automatically evaluating our methods, we propose to use widely used metric for image/video captioning. This is because the proposed CommonGen task can be regarded as also a caption task where the context are incomplete scenes with given concept-sets. Therefore, we choose BLEU-3/4 BIBREF28, ROUGE-2/L BIBREF29, CIDEr BIBREF30, and SPICE BIBREF31 as the main metrics. Apart from these classic metrics, we also include a novel embedding-based metric named BERTScore BIBREF32. To make the comparisons more clear, we show the delta of BERTScore results by subtracting the score of merely using input concept-sets as target sentences, named $\\triangle $BERTS.\nTo have an estimation about human performance in each metric, we iteratively treat every reference sentence in dev/test data as the prediction to be compared with all references (including itself). That is, if a model has the same reasoning ability with average performance of our crowd workers, its results should exceed this “human bound”.\n\nEvaluation ::: Experimental Results\nWe present the experimental results of five groups of methods that are introduced in Section SECREF4. We find that the model UniLM outperforms all other baseline methods by a large margin, which is expected due to it is pre-trained with the BERT encoder towards generation objectives. However, its performance is still way far from the human bound, and this margin is even larger in test data.\nWe notice that the most recent edit-based model named LevenTrans archives the best performance among models without pre-training at all. This shows that edit-based sequence generation models can better deal with the cases where target sentences share similar vocabulary with source ones. Nonetheless, the other two models within the same sequence modeling framework (i.e. fairseq) are much worse, which might because of their specialty designed for machine translation.\nAn order-insensitive sequence/set encoder, “mean encoder”, outperform order-sensitive counterparts like “bRNN”. However, such a marginal improvement is not seen in the comparison between “Trans.” vs “Trans. w/o Pos”. We assume that for short sequences the order sensitivity does not harm sequential encoders, while positional embeddings in Transformers can better improve the self-attention mechanism. Also, we find that Transformer-based seq2seq architectures are not outperforming simpler models like bRNN.\nAs for the use of additional retrieved sentences form OMCS corpus and human-written associated rationales, we find that they are not generally helpful in investigated architectures. Although they increase the BLEU and ROUGE scores, the metrics specially designed for captioning like CIDEr and SPICE are dropping down. We argue that it might because the OMCS sentences are actually not aligned with training data, and more sophisticated methods for encoding such non-sequential facts in a more compositional way.\n\nEvaluation ::: Qualitative Analysis\nFor more clearly observe the performance of interested models, we present several real system outputs on the test set in Table TABREF24. We find that models usually cannot cover all given concepts, and also can produce repetitions of given concepts (e.g. “a dog catches a dog”, “a couple of couples”, and “at an object and an object .”). Moreover, we find that the order of actions may be mot natural. For example, the model output “a man pulls a sword out of his mouth and swallows it” makes less sense because a man usually swallow a sword first before he pull it out in such performances.\n\nRelated Work ::: Machine Common Sense\nMachine common sense (MCS) has long been considered as one of the most significant area in artificial intelligence. Recently, there are various emerging datasets for testing machine commonsense from different angles, such as commonsense extraction BIBREF33, BIBREF34, next situation prediction (SWAG BIBREF1, CODAH BIBREF35, HellaSWAG BIBREF36), cultural/social understanding BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39, visual scene comprehension BIBREF40, and general commonsense question answering BIBREF0, BIBREF41. Most of them are in a multi-choice QA setting for discriminative commonsense reasoning, among which CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1 are two typical examples. The input of the CSQA task is a question that needs commonsense reasoning and there are five candidate answers (words/phrases). The SWAG task asks models to select which situation is the most plausible next situation, given a sentence describing an event.\nThe two tasks share very similar objectives with large pre-trained language encoders like BERT BIBREF42: Masked-LM can predict the missing words in an incomplete sentence, which is similar to the CSQA setting; NextSentPrediction classifies whether a sentence is the next sentence of the given sentence in the corpora, which can be seen as using distant supervision for the SWAG task. Thus, simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF43, BIBREF2, but it does not necessarily mean machine reasoners can really produce new assumptions in an open and generative setting. The proposed CommonGen, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dataset and task for generative commonsense reasoning.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we purpose a novel constrained text generation task for generative commonsense reasoning. We introduce a new large-scale dataset named CommonGen and investigate various methods on them. Through our extensive experiments and human evaluation, we demonstrate that the inherent difficulties of the new task cannot be addressed by even the state-of-the-art pre-trained language generation model.\nFor the future research, we believe the following directions are highly valuable to explore: 1) specially designed metrics for automatic evaluation that focus on commonsense plausibility; 2) better mechanisms for retrieving and imposing useful commonsense knowledge into sentence generation processes; 3) explicitly modeling keyword-centric edits (e.g. insertion, deletion, morphological changes) such that relevant commonsense knowledge can be well utilized. We also believe that models performed well on CommonGen can be easily transferred to other commonsense-required reasoning tasks with few annotations, including image/video captioning, visual question answering, and discriminative multi-choice commonsense question answering.\n\nFigure 1: A motivating example for generative commonsense reasoning and the COMMONGEN task.

For example, given {apple(noun), tree(noun), pick(verb)}, humans can easily come up with scenes like \"a boy is picking an apple from a tree\" via their generative commonsense reasoning ability. However, we find this capacity has not been well learned by machines. Most prior works in machine commonsense focus on discriminative reasoning tasks with a multi-choice question answering setting. Herein, we present CommonGen: a challenging dataset for testing generative commonsense reasoning with a constrained text generation task. We collect 37k concept-sets as inputs and 90k human-written sentences as associated outputs. Additionally, we also provide high-quality rationales behind the reasoning process for the development and test sets from the human annotators. We demonstrate the difficulty of the task by examining a wide range of sequence generation methods with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The state-of-the-art pre-trained generation model, UniLM, is still far from human performance in this task. Our data and code is publicly available at this http URL .\n\nIntroduction\nCommonsense reasoning has long been acknowledged as a critical bottleneck of artificial intelligence and especially in natural language processing. It is an ability of combining commonsense facts and logic rules to make new presumptions about ordinary scenes in our daily life. A distinct property of commonsense reasoning problems is that they are generally trivial for human-beings while challenging for machine reasoners.\nThere have been a few recent tasks and datasets for testing machine commonsense, while most of them frame their problems as multi-choice question answering, such as CSQA BIBREF0 and SWAG BIBREF1. We name this kind of tasks as deterministic commonsense reasoning because they focus on modeling the plausibility of given complete scenes. The systems for these tasks thus have to work with biased selection of distractors, and thus are less practical or challenging. Simply fine-tuning such large pre-trained language encoders can yield near or exceeding human performance BIBREF2. On the other hand, few work has been done so far in testing machine commonsense in a generative reasoning setting, where a reasoner is expected to complete scenes with several given concepts.\nSpecifically, we would like to investigate if machine-reasoning models can generate a sentence that contains a required set of concepts (i.e. nouns or verbs) while describing a common scene in our daily life. For example, as shown in Figure FIGREF1, given an unordered collection of concepts “{apple (noun), bag (noun), pick (verb), place (verb), tree (noun)}”, a rational reasoner should be able to generate a sentence like “A boy picks some apples from a tree and places them into a bag.”, which describes a natural scene and contains all given concepts. The creation of this sentence is easy for humans while non-trivial for even state-of-the-art conditional language generation models. We argue that such an ability of recovering natural scenes of daily life can benefit a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks including image/video captioning BIBREF3, BIBREF4, scene-based visual reasoning and VQA BIBREF5, storytelling BIBREF6, and dialogue systems BIBREF7, BIBREF8.\nTowards empowering machines with the generative commonsense reasoning ability, we create a large-scale dataset, named CommonGen, for the constrained text generation task. We collect $37,263$ concept-sets as the inputs, each of which contains three to five common concepts. These concept-sets are sampled from several large corpora of image/video captions, such that the concepts inside them are more likely to co-occur in natural scenes. Through crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we finally obtain $89,028$ human-written sentences as expected outputs. We investigate the performance of sophisticated sequence generation methods for the proposed task with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The experiments show that all methods are far from human performance in generative commonsense reasoning. Our main contributions are as follows: 1) We introduce the first large-scale constrained text generation dataset targeting at generative commonsense reasoning; 2) We systematically compare methods for this (lexically) constrained text generation with extensive experiments and evaluation. 3) Our code and data are publicly available (w/ the URL in the abstract), so future research in this direction can be directly developed in a unified framework.\n\nProblem Formulation\nIn this section, we formulate our task with mathematical notations and discuss its inherent challenges. The input to the task is a set of $n$ concepts $x=\\lbrace c_1,c_2,\\dots ,c_n\\rbrace \\in \\mathcal {X}$, where $c_i\\in \\mathcal {C}$ is a common noun or verb. $\\mathcal {X}$ denotes the space of concept-sets and $\\mathcal {C}$ stands for the concept vocabulary. The expected output of this task is a simple, grammatical sentence $y\\in \\mathcal {Y}$, describing a natural scene in our daily-life that covers all given concepts in $x$. Note that other forms of given concepts are also accepted, such as plural forms of nouns and verbs. In addition, we also provide rationales as an optional resource to model the generation process. For each pair of $(x, y)$, a rationale $r$ is a list of sentences that explains the background commonsense knowledge used in the scene recovering process.\nThe task is to learn a structured predictive function $f:\\mathcal {X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal {Y}$, which maps a concept-set to a sentence. Thus, it can be seen as a special case of constrained text generation BIBREF9. The unique challenges of our proposed task come from two main aspects as follows.\nConstrained Decoding. Lexically constrained decoding for sentence generation has been an important and challenging research topic in machine translation community BIBREF10, where they focus on how to decode sentences when some words/phrases (e.g. terminology) must present in target sentences (Section SECREF6). However, it is still an open problem how to efficiently generate sentences given an unordered set of multiple keywords with potential morphological changes (e.g. “pick” $\\rightarrow $ “picks” in the previous case). Apart from that, the part-of-speech constraints brings even more difficulties (e.g. “place” can be verb/noun).\nCommonsense Reasoning. Apart from the challenge in constrained decoding, a generative commonsense reasoner also has to compositionally use (latent) commonsense knowledge for generating most plausible scenes. Recall the illustrative example in Figure FIGREF1, even such a simple scene generation process needs pretty much commonsense knowledge like: 1) “apples grow in trees”; 2) “bags are containers that you can put something in”; 3) “you usually pick something and then place it in a container”. Expected reasoners have to prioritize target scenes over an infinity number of less plausible scenes like “A boy picks an apple tree and places it into bags.” or “A boy places some bags on a tree and picks an apple.”.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Crowd-Sourcing via AMT\nIt is true that the above-mentioned associated caption sentences for each concept-set are human-written and do describe scenes that cover all given concepts. However, they are created under specific contexts (i.e. an image or a video) and thus might be less representative for common sense. To better measure the quality and interpretability of generative reasoners, we need to evaluate them with scenes and rationales created by using concept-sets only as the signals for annotators.\nWe collect more human-written scenes for each concept-set in dev and test set through crowd-sourcing via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Each input concept-set is annotated by at least three different humans. The annotators are also required to give sentences as the rationales, which further encourage them to use common sense in creating their scenes. The crowd-sourced sentences correlate well with the associated captions, meaning that it is reasonable to use caption sentences as training data although they can be partly noisy. Additionally, we utilize a search engine over the OMCS corpus BIBREF16 for retrieving relevant propositions as distant rationales in training data.\n\nThe CommonGen Dataset ::: Statistics\nWe present the statistical information of our final dataset. Firstly, we summarize the basic statistics in Table TABREF9, such as the number of unique concept-sets, scene sentences, and sentence lengths. In total, there are 3,706 unique concepts among all concept-sets, and 3,614/1,018/1,207 in the train/dev/test parts respectively. Note that there are 4% of the dev and 6% of the test concepts never appear in the training data, so we can better understand how well trained models can perform with unseen concepts.\nWe analyze the overlap between training concept-sets and dev/test concept-sets. By average, we find that 98.8% of the training instances share no common concept at all with dev/test data, such that the dev/test can help us analyze model performance on new combinations of concepts.\nWe also visualize the frequency distribution of our test concept-sets in Figure FIGREF7 by showing the frequency of top 50 single concepts and co-occurred concept pairs.\n\nMethods ::: Other methods\nBased on the similarity between our task and abstractive summarization and story generation (with given topic words), we also apply Pointer Generator Networks (“PointerGen”) BIBREF26 and Multi-scale Fusion Attention (“Fusion Attn.”) BIBREF27 model respectively for our task.\n\nEvaluation ::: Setup\nWe use the proposed CommonGen dataset in two setting: knowledge-agnostic and knowledge-aware. For the knowledge-agnostic setting, we simply apply the methods in Section SECREF4 while we concatenate rationales and input concept-sets together as the knowledge-aware inputs (“$+r$”).\n\nEvaluation ::: Automatic Metrics\nFor automatically evaluating our methods, we propose to use widely used metric for image/video captioning. This is because the proposed CommonGen task can be regarded as also a caption task where the context are incomplete scenes with given concept-sets. Therefore, we choose BLEU-3/4 BIBREF28, ROUGE-2/L BIBREF29, CIDEr BIBREF30, and SPICE BIBREF31 as the main metrics. Apart from these classic metrics, we also include a novel embedding-based metric named BERTScore BIBREF32. To make the comparisons more clear, we show the delta of BERTScore results by subtracting the score of merely using input concept-sets as target sentences, named $\\triangle $BERTS.\nTo have an estimation about human performance in each metric, we iteratively treat every reference sentence in dev/test data as the prediction to be compared with all references (including itself). That is, if a model has the same reasoning ability with average performance of our crowd workers, its results should exceed this “human bound”.\n\nEvaluation ::: Experimental Results\nWe present the experimental results of five groups of methods that are introduced in Section SECREF4. We find that the model UniLM outperforms all other baseline methods by a large margin, which is expected due to it is pre-trained with the BERT encoder towards generation objectives. However, its performance is still way far from the human bound, and this margin is even larger in test data.\nWe notice that the most recent edit-based model named LevenTrans archives the best performance among models without pre-training at all. This shows that edit-based sequence generation models can better deal with the cases where target sentences share similar vocabulary with source ones. Nonetheless, the other two models within the same sequence modeling framework (i.e. fairseq) are much worse, which might because of their specialty designed for machine translation.\nAn order-insensitive sequence/set encoder, “mean encoder”, outperform order-sensitive counterparts like “bRNN”. However, such a marginal improvement is not seen in the comparison between “Trans.” vs “Trans. w/o Pos”. We assume that for short sequences the order sensitivity does not harm sequential encoders, while positional embeddings in Transformers can better improve the self-attention mechanism. Also, we find that Transformer-based seq2seq architectures are not outperforming simpler models like bRNN.\nAs for the use of additional retrieved sentences form OMCS corpus and human-written associated rationales, we find that they are not generally helpful in investigated architectures. Although they increase the BLEU and ROUGE scores, the metrics specially designed for captioning like CIDEr and SPICE are dropping down. We argue that it might because the OMCS sentences are actually not aligned with training data, and more sophisticated methods for encoding such non-sequential facts in a more compositional way.\n\nEvaluation ::: Qualitative Analysis\nFor more clearly observe the performance of interested models, we present several real system outputs on the test set in Table TABREF24. We find that models usually cannot cover all given concepts, and also can produce repetitions of given concepts (e.g. “a dog catches a dog”, “a couple of couples”, and “at an object and an object .”). Moreover, we find that the order of actions may be mot natural. For example, the model output “a man pulls a sword out of his mouth and swallows it” makes less sense because a man usually swallow a sword first before he pull it out in such performances.\n\nRelated Work ::: Machine Common Sense\nMachine common sense (MCS) has long been considered as one of the most significant area in artificial intelligence.

E.g.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 2)`: Dissimilarity `0`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 3)`: Dissimilarity `1`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 2, 1)`: Dissimilarity `2`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(3, 4, 5)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(2, 0, 1)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n\n\\*\\*Question\\*\\*: What is a good algorithm for finding the ordering of `data` which minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between all neighboring 3-tuples?\n\n### Some code\nHere's a function which computes the dissimilarity between two 3-tuples:\n```python\ndef dissimilar(t1, t2):\n return sum(int(a != b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\nHere's a function which computes the summed total dissimilarity of `data`, i.e. the number which I seek to minimize:\n```python\ndef score(data):\n return sum(dissimilar(t1, t2) for t1, t2 in zip(data, data[1:]))\n```\nThe problem can be solved by simply running `score()` over every permutation of `data`:\n```python\nimport itertools\nn\\_min = 3\\*len(data) # some large number\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(data):\n n = score(perm)\n if n < n\\_min:\n n\\_min = n\n data\\_sorted = list(perm)\nprint(data\\_sorted, n\\_min)\n```\nThough the above works, it's very slow as we explicitly check each and every permutation (resulting in O(N!) complexity). On my machine the above takes about 20 seconds when `data` has 10 elements.\nFor completeness, here's the result of running the above given the example `data`:\n```python\ndata\\_sorted = [\n (1, 0, 5),\n (4, 0, 3),\n (4, 3, 4),\n (0, 3, 5),\n (3, 3, 1),\n (3, 2, 1),\n (1, 5, 1),\n (1, 5, 2),\n (1, 2, 2),\n (2, 4, 2),\n]\n```\n\nwith `n\\_min = 15`. Note that several other orderings (`10` in total) with a score of `15` exist. For my purposes these are all equivalent and I just want one of them.\n### Final remarks\nIn practice the size of `data` may be as large as say `10000`.\nThe sought-after algorithm should beat O(N!), i.e. probably be polynomial in time (and space).\nIf no such algorithm exists, I would be interested in \"near-solutions\", i.e. a fast algorithm which gives an ordering of `data` with a small but not necessarily minimal total score. One such algorithm would be [lexicographic sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic\\_order), i.e.\n```python\nsorted(data) # score 18\n```\nthough I hope to be able to do better than this.\n### Edit (comments on accepted solution)\nI have tried all of the below heuristic solutions given as code (I have not tried e.g. Google OR-tools). For large `len(data)`, I find that the solution of Andrej Kesely is both quick and gives the best results.\nThe idea behind this method is quite simple. The sorted list of data elements (3-tuples) is built up one by one. Given some data element, the next element is chosen to be the most similar one out of the remaining (not yet part of the sorted) data.\nEssentially this solves a localized version of the problem where we only \"look \\_one\\_ ahead\", rather than optimizing globally over the entire data set. We can imagine a hierarchy of algorithms looking `n` ahead, each successively delivering better (or at least as good) results but at the cost of being much more expensive. The solution of Andrej Kesely then sits lowest in this hierarchy. The algorithm at the highest spot, looking `len(data)` ahead, solves the problem exactly.\nLet's settle for \"looking 1 ahead\", i.e. the answer by Andrej Kesely. This leaves room for a) the choice of initial element, b) what to do when several elements are equally good candidates (same dissimilarity) for use as the next one. Choosing the first element in `data` as the initial element and the first occurrence of an element with minimal dissimilarity, both a) and b) are determined from the original order of elements within `data`. As Andrej Kesely points out, it then helps to (lex)sort `data` in advance.\nIn the end I went with this solution, but refined in a few ways:\n- I try out the algorithm for 6 initial sortings of `data`; lex sort for columns `(0, 1, 2)`, `(2, 0, 1)`, `(1, 2, 0)`, all in ascending as well as descending order.\n- For large `len(data)`, the algorithm becomes too slow for me. I suspect it scales like `O(n²)`. I thus process chunks of the data of size `n\\_max` independently, with the final result being the different sorted chunks concatenated. Transitioning from one chunk to the next we expect a dissimilarity of 3, but this is unimportant if we keep `n\\_max` large. I go with `n\\_max = 1000`.\nAs an implementation note, the performance can be improved by not using `data.pop(idx)` as this itself is `O(n)`. Instead, either leave the original `data` as is and use another data structure for keeping track of which elements/indices have been used, or replace `data[idx]` with some marker value upon use.",

Please summarize the key findings of the work in 1-2 sentences.\n\nPaper text: Large pre-trained Transformers such as BERT have been tremendously effective for many NLP tasks.\n However, inference in these large-capacity models is prohibitively slow and expensive\n. Transformers are essentially a stack of self-attention layers which encode each input position using the entire input sequence as its context\n. However, we find that it may not be necessary to apply this expensive sequence-wide self-attention over at all layers\n. Based on this observation, we propose a decomposition to a pre-trained Transformer that allows the lower layers to process segments of the input independently enabling parallelism and caching\n. We show that the information loss due to this decomposition can be recovered in the upper layers with auxiliary supervision during fine-tuning\n.  We evaluate de-composition with pre-trained BERT models on five different paired-input tasks in question answering, sentence similarity, and natural language inference\n.  Results show that decomposition enables faster inference (up to 4x), significant memory reduction (up to 70%) while retaining most (up to 99%) of the original performance\n. We will release the code at<anonymized url>.\nInference in large Transformer-based NLP models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) requires prohibitively high-levels of compute, making it expensive to support large volume processing in data centers, and almost infeasible to run on resource constrained mobile devices.\nThese Transformer models create effective representations using self-attention, a mechanism that allows them to effectively account for wide textual contexts.\nHowever, applying self-attention over the entire input for all layers is computationally expensive.\nThis raises a natural question: Is self-attention over the entire input necessary in all of the layers?\nPrevious studies (Tenney et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019b) have shown that lower layers tend to capture syntactic phenomena that mostly depend on local contexts and that higher layers capture more semantic phenomena that are relevant to downstream tasks, which depend on longer global contexts.\nThis suggests that considering only local context in lower layers of Transformer and considering full global context in upper layers can provide speedup at a very small cost in terms of effectiveness.\nIn this work we focus on paired-input NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, natural language inference and sentence pair similarity.\nThese tasks provide a natural boundary for the locality of text (e.g., question vs. passage in QA).\nBecause of this natural decomposition in two segments, we can compute representations for lower layers with only the local segment as the context and compute representations for upper layers with both segments as the context.\nThis decomposition technique has multiple benefits: It allows for parallel processing of each segment, caching of segments that are available offline, and a significant reduction in runtime memory.\nMoreover, since the architecture remains largely same, the original pre-trained weights can be reused in the decomposed model.\nTo compensate for the differences in the decomposed setting, we augment the fine-tuning loss on the target task with a distillation loss that minimizes the output-level as well as layer-level divergences.\nWe evaluate the decomposition idea using the BERT model on five different pairwise tasks.\nThe decomposition achieves substantial speedup (2 to 4.3x) and reduction in memory (51.1% to 76.8%) for only small loss in effectiveness (0.2 to 1.8 points).\nMoreover, we find that with decomposition the larger BERT model can even run faster than the original smaller BERT model, while still being more accurate.\nTransformers have improved the effectiveness of NLP tools by their ability to incorporate large contexts effectively in multiple layers.\nThis however imposes a significant complexity cost.\nIn this work, we showed that modeling such large contexts may not always be necessary and leverage this insight to build a decomposition of the Transformer model that provides substantial improvements in inference speed, memory reduction, while retaining most of the original model's accuracy.\nThis decomposition model provides a simple yet strong starting point for efficient models as NLP moves towards increasingly larger models handling wider contexts.\n\nSummary:",

We started with the duck tidbits which were sweet and sour and crispy and fun. They tasted great with the next round of Mai Tai's! Our entrees were the curry chicken, which comes with all sorts of add-ons like currants and chutney and spices, and the duck mu shu, which was as luxurious and crispy as I had hoped for! After another round of drinks we weren't sure we could handle dessert, but we shared a nice vanilla ice cream rolled in coconut and set in chocolate. From about 8pm on there was a live band that was pretty good - they did a few covers that were really nice and it wasn't overwhelmingly loud.

The question this July remains the same as it was last July: Will things work out for Tony Mitchell?\n\nMitchell's case received far less media attention than did Kanter's, in part because Mitchell wasn't at Kentucky, and in part because his issues involved academics, not compensation. The 6-8 power forward was, at No. 12 overall in Rivals' rankings, the highest-rated player ever to sign with Mizzou, but his high school transcripts drew major red flags from the NCAA.

He transferred to Dallas' Pinkston High for his senior season and tried to retake core courses at an impermissible pace; a local school district investigation led to his transcripts being invalidated, and his graduation was delayed while he struggled with a state exit test. Mitchell remained at home in Dallas during what would've been his first college semester, and his eligibility saga dragged into January, when he got word that he'd never be able to play for the Tigers.\n\nForced to choose between the junior college route or attending a four-year school as a partial qualifier, Mitchell enrolled at North Texas, where he's now a student paying in-state tuition. Mean Green coach Johnny Jones had aggressively recruited Mitchell out of high school and is hoping for a second chance to coach the local phenom. \"We felt we were right there,\" Jones said, \"So when he committed to Missouri, it was like we lost a battle.\" Mitchell needs to pass 24 credit hours to be eligible to practice with UNT on Dec. 17, following the conclusion of its fall semester, and potentially debut on Dec. 18 at home against LSU. Until then, he can't work out with the team, and has had to settle for dominating at the campus rec center, where he's become an intramural-league legend*.\n\n(* An actual message-board post inspired by one of Mitchell's games in February: \"While getting beat by 30 in my rec game tonight I witnessed the greatest basketball player I've ever seen in person (not in the NBA)... Tony Mitchell. While playing in front of a crowd of about 100, at about 30% effort, he showed just how much better he was than anyone on that court. You can just tell that he is legit NBA prospect. My favorite was his between the legs power dunk on a fast break. I heart him. The end.\" [sic])\n\nMitchell said that his progress toward that 24-credit goal was \"beyond half done,\" and that he's on track to join the North Texas team for the bulk of its season. It should be noted that he told me last summer that everything would be fine at Missouri, which didn't turn out to be the case, so his start date shouldn't be viewed as a lock. But Jones, too, expresses optimism that Mitchell will suit up this year, based on what the coach has seen out of his 2011 coursework. \"Tony's been so focused and determined to have the opportunity to play,\" Jones said. \"If he stays that focused, he'll be on target to play on Dec. 18.\"\n\nThe one coach Mitchell has been able to play for this year is George Mason's Paul Hewitt, who headed the U.S. U19 team and considered the 6-8 forward a key defensive contributor. With potential interior stars such as Ohio State's Jared Sullinger and Kentucky's Terrence Jones and Anthony Davis turning down invites, the U.S.' only other frontcourt players were Florida's Patric Young, Illinois' Meyers Leonard, Creighton's Doug McDermott and Butler's Khyle Marshall, and Mitchell ended up playing 15.8 minutes per game backing up Young and McDermott. As raw as Mitchell is skill-wise -- the fact that he hadn't been in a college program for a year was evident in Latvia -- he still managed to post attention-grabbing numbers by crashing the glass and flying in from the weak side for blocks.\n\nA per-28-minute, tempo-free analysis of the U19s published at In-The-Game.org ranked Mitchell's efficiency rating (20.4) second in the entire tournament, behind only Lithuania's Jonas Valanciunas, who was the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft and by far the best player in Riga. Mitchell only averaged half as many minutes (15.8 mpg) as Valanciunas, but had a higher rebounding rate (0.47 rpm) and block rate (0.11 bpm) than the future Raptors center.\n\nNBA scouts had been especially curious to see Mitchell, who as a high school senior beat out Baylor's Perry Jones -- a possible top-three pick in 2012 -- for the Dallas Morning News' area player of the year honors. And while Mitchell didn't do anything in Latvia that particularly wowed NBA evaluators, he made enough of an impact to warrant future visits to Denton, where he could grow into a first-round pick. \"He's a great athlete, but he's just playing on instinct right now,\" one scout said. \"He hasn't developed a feel for the game yet.\"\n\nMitchell's athleticism alone will be enough to make him stand out in the Sun Belt, a conference that rarely features athletes of his caliber, and never lands recruits of his status. He longingly watched Missouri games on TV for the first half of 2010-11, wondering what he might've done in the Tigers' frontcourt, and thinks he could help the Mean Green, who lost their opening NCAA tournament game last March, pull off upsets in the postseason.\n\n\"I'll be trying to make a huge impact right away,\" he said. \"I should make a huge impact. I'll be playing to win, and entertain at the same time -- you know, throwing down dunks, the usual.\"\n\nIt was hard not to laugh at Mitchell's secondary goal of \"entertainment,\" but that comment as a whole was indicative of how overeager he is to get on the floor in Denton. He's desperate to do something, anything, to prove that he's still an elite player, as opposed to a cautionary tale of a once-hyped recruit. All of his American frontcourt mates should benefit from their international experience; for Young and Leonard, it could set the stage for breakout sophomore seasons as they take on starting roles stateside. But for Mitchell, it was something else entirely: a respite from his academic purgatory, a reminder of how far he has to go to catch up to his peers, and for the first time in a year, the chance to function as part of a team. He needed the U19 trip more than did anyone else on the roster.\n\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.",

The end.\" [sic])\n\nMitchell said that his progress toward that 24-credit goal was \"beyond half done,\" and that he's on track to join the North Texas team for the bulk of its season. It should be noted that he told me last summer that everything would be fine at Missouri, which didn't turn out to be the case, so his start date shouldn't be viewed as a lock. But Jones, too, expresses optimism that Mitchell will suit up this year, based on what the coach has seen out of his 2011 coursework. \"Tony's been so focused and determined to have the opportunity to play,\" Jones said. \"If he stays that focused, he'll be on target to play on Dec. 18.\"\n\nThe one coach Mitchell has been able to play for this year is George Mason's Paul Hewitt, who headed the U.S. U19 team and considered the 6-8 forward a key defensive contributor. With potential interior stars such as Ohio State's Jared Sullinger and Kentucky's Terrence Jones and Anthony Davis turning down invites, the U.S.' only other frontcourt players were Florida's Patric Young, Illinois' Meyers Leonard, Creighton's Doug McDermott and Butler's Khyle Marshall, and Mitchell ended up playing 15.8 minutes per game backing up Young and McDermott. As raw as Mitchell is skill-wise -- the fact that he hadn't been in a college program for a year was evident in Latvia -- he still managed to post attention-grabbing numbers by crashing the glass and flying in from the weak side for blocks.\n\nA per-28-minute, tempo-free analysis of the U19s published at In-The-Game.org ranked Mitchell's efficiency rating (20.4) second in the entire tournament, behind only Lithuania's Jonas Valanciunas, who was the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft and by far the best player in Riga. Mitchell only averaged half as many minutes (15.8 mpg) as Valanciunas, but had a higher rebounding rate (0.47 rpm) and block rate (0.11 bpm) than the future Raptors center.\n\nNBA scouts had been especially curious to see Mitchell, who as a high school senior beat out Baylor's Perry Jones -- a possible top-three pick in 2012 -- for the Dallas Morning News' area player of the year honors. And while Mitchell didn't do anything in Latvia that particularly wowed NBA evaluators, he made enough of an impact to warrant future visits to Denton, where he could grow into a first-round pick. \"He's a great athlete, but he's just playing on instinct right now,\" one scout said. \"He hasn't developed a feel for the game yet.\"\n\nMitchell's athleticism alone will be enough to make him stand out in the Sun Belt, a conference that rarely features athletes of his caliber, and never lands recruits of his status. He longingly watched Missouri games on TV for the first half of 2010-11, wondering what he might've done in the Tigers' frontcourt, and thinks he could help the Mean Green, who lost their opening NCAA tournament game last March, pull off upsets in the postseason.\n\n\"I'll be trying to make a huge impact right away,\" he said. \"I should make a huge impact. I'll be playing to win, and entertain at the same time -- you know, throwing down dunks, the usual.\"\n\nIt was hard not to laugh at Mitchell's secondary goal of \"entertainment,\" but that comment as a whole was indicative of how overeager he is to get on the floor in Denton. He's desperate to do something, anything, to prove that he's still an elite player, as opposed to a cautionary tale of a once-hyped recruit. All of his American frontcourt mates should benefit from their international experience; for Young and Leonard, it could set the stage for breakout sophomore seasons as they take on starting roles stateside. But for Mitchell, it was something else entirely: a respite from his academic purgatory, a reminder of how far he has to go to catch up to his peers, and for the first time in a year, the chance to function as part of a team. He needed the U19 trip more than did anyone else on the roster.\n\nWrite a one or two sentence summary. Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.",
